Eighteen participants across six organizations interested in using open government data to investigate COVID-19 spending registered and attended the data party. 

Since the whole activity of the day was conceived to be mainly interactive, at the point of registration, provision was made for participants to indicate what they want to learn, share and open data is of interest to them. The feedback from this exercise was used to place participants into groups during the story ideation session.

The Abuja Open Data Day event focused on five main themes.
• Introduction to open data
• Open data as a tool for advocacy, transparency and accountability
• Where to find open data on COVID-19 spending in Nigeria
• The marriage between compelling and accountability COVID-19 stories

Journalism in the age of open dataIn general, the event outlined the process of spotting red flags in COVID-19 dataset and reporting the red flags. It presented the various sources of COVID-19 spending datasets in Nigerian. Also, the event presented the various strategies of interrogating COVID-19 data for procurement fraud. ","Participants of the Abuja Open Data Day agreed to the following:
1. To not only be problem pointers or corruption pointers but also project solutions that can be used to amend the situation
2. Present the local, national and international perspective when birthing a COVID-19 story so as to showcase international best practices and policies as solutions. 
3. To think of multimedia as an audience engagement strategy while delivering investigative stories especially on COVID-19.
4. To increase public procurement transparency and government accountability by carrying out a deeper analysis of budget, procurement, and revenue data.
5. Increase the advocacy for open government data",I love open data day because it provides an opportunity for an interactive and skill share session on the use of freely available data for the purpose of demanding transparency and accountability of public institutions and processes.,,abuja-open-data-day,WAT,https://www.dataphyte.com/,EMEA,"Europe, Middle East & Africa"

In a series of meetings from March to May, participants will be introduced to OpenStreetMap (OSM) and to some examples of how the database is used. Moreover, they will learn how to manage the most popular and innovative tools through mapping sessions.


The event on March 5th is held on the occasion of Open Data Day 2021 (March 6th), an annual celebration of open data all over the world.

The event took place on March 5 from 16 to 19 CET in virtual mode and was attended by more than 90 people, including students of Politecnico di Milano, with a strong diversity of backgrounds.

During the event, participants were introduced to the world of collaborative mapping through an overview of the [OpenStreetMap project](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), its uses, and the most common tools available to contribute. The [YouthMappers network](https://www.youthmappers.org/) and the [PoliMappers group](https://polimappers.github.io/) were also introduced.

In the second part of the event, we had the honour of hosting Dimitris Karakostis, Technical Manager and Senior Geospatial Officer at [World Food Programme](https://www.wfp.org/), who explained to the participants how WFP uses OpenStreetMap data to update its mapping resources and thus provide optimal support to people working in the field.

Finally, in the third part of the event, we provided a short tutorial to learn how to map the simplest features, namely buildings, with iDeditor. Participants then collaborated on mapping project 1148 on [TeachOSM ""Mapping Tartus""](https://tasks.teachosm.org/projects/1148), created to enrich the geographical information of that area of Syria, where WFP is operating.","Thanks to the event, as organisers we were able to see that the interest in collaborative and open mapping is shared by people with very different academic/professional/personal backgrounds from all over the world. In particular, considerable curiosity emerged in relation to the tools and technologies that can be used by anyone to contribute to mapping for humanitarian purposes.

As for the participants, they acquired basic mapping skills that will be enriched during our [upcoming events](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PoliMappers/Collaborative_and_Humanitarian_Mapping_2021) and, in general, the usefulness of the contributions, as they are closely related to the work of WFP, has been enhanced.

Finally, the practical part of the event produced [excellent results](https://resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-changesets?comment=opendataday%20polimappers#10/34.9456/36.0942) in terms of quantity (more than 50 OSM users mapped over 5000 buildings) and quality (the contributions were validated by the PoliMappers team and in general a good level of mapping was found).","We love Open Data Day because it's an opportunity to introduce many people to the world of open data, especially regarding geographic information in our case.

More specifically, this workshop aimed at starting a debate about how municipal estates could play a role in rethinking housing, commons and care, going beyond the models of property we usually work with. 

We asked the participants (16 persons) to share experiences, knowledge, information, ideas about the following topics: concepts of community and sharing, social architecture, inspirations/models, local initiatives, available data and mapping and legal framework. Engaging in a horizontal discussion and using a collaborative whiteboard provided the structure for mapping experiences, data sources and ideas. The participants decided to follow with monthly meetings. 

The group - approximately 25 people including those who expressed interest but couldn't participate this time - will be invited to continue forming a working group to learn, explore and build an advocacy strategy. 

There are different lines of action we would like to follow:

• Exploring visions about urban space based on the concepts of commons and care to develop concrete projects and imagine a more comprehensive change, including legislative one.
• Learning from other initiatives and study their advocacy strategies, as well as sharing the learnt lessons to spread and replicate projects. 
• Creating alliances with other housing rights movements to join forces and discuss conflicting interests and intersecting processes. 
• Mapping and visualising data about municipal and state-owned real estate - based both on the public inventory of vacant properties and grassroots mapping initiatives. 
• Looking at data on housing inequalities. Using data visualisation as a tool of advocacy.","The event provided an occasion for mapping relevant actors and knowledge and established a starting point for a process that holds the potential to create alliances and set up a joint advocacy strategy. The workshop highlighted the importance of creating, reinforcing and connecting grassroots initiatives and movements that promote alternative perspectives on housing by creating spaces of collective learning.","We believe in and work towards the vision of knowledge as commons. Indeed, the collective TuTela Learning Network bases its initiatives on the idea of radical sharing and the importance of connecting and sharing activist knowledge. We see Open Data Day as an opportunity to raise awareness among activists on the opportunities that engaging with open data holds for movements. Our workshop joined people from different perspectives and backgrounds in a horizontal discussion and sharing between participants.

Brazil has a primary health care network in the Unified Health System (SUS) composed of community agents and family health professionals who work together in the territory with the most vulnerable population. However, this performance occurs with little (or no) knowledge organized in maps. YouthMappers UFBA supports training activities for these professionals and intends to count on the OSM community to map, at this moment, one of the precarious areas of the city that has been suffering from COVID-19 and in which one of these groups of health professionals work.

Community health workers and family health professionals play a fundamental role for these people, as they are the ones who visit the territory, the homes, recognizing the problems at their origin. To do their job, they often make schematic maps on paper and do not use existing maps. In OpenStreetMap, most of these more precarious areas still do not have their buildings mapped, and this is a layer that can help a lot in the work of these agents. That is why YouthMappers UFBA has been supporting the GeoCombate COVID-19 BA Group and seeking to map the most precarious areas of the City of Salvador.

Then, we carried out three more activities: workshop 1 - OSM ID and HOT Tasking Manager with Wille Marcel (Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team), the second YouthMappers Brasil Meeting, and a map of the YouthMappers UFBA Chapter. Since then, every Friday we have held workshops with other platforms bringing experiences from different researchers and communities that used them for their mapping.

Still we managed to attract many people. Attendance was mixed from members of the public to corporate actors and government.

The point of the event was to introduce solutions based on mapping open data that exist but should be communicated more amongst the public and also put in practice. These are the solutions that can make an everyday life of each and every one of us easier. For instance, the Council of Ljubljana has created numerous apps to make living in Ljubljana easier. One of these is for instance “[Trenutek v Ljubljani](https://www.ljubljana.si/sl/trenutek-v-ljubljani/)” (A moment in Ljubljana) where Ljubljana citizens can see all traffic relevant information, availability of parking spaces, bikes, walking routes and also the quality of air and water at your location. Slovenia and Ljubljana are in the earthquake zone. The Council of Ljubljana has also [created an app](http://potrog2.vokas.si/) where each citizen can evaluate earthquake consequences on its residency. This app is unfortunately very unknown to the public and should be properly disseminated. 

Slovenia is in economic crises. The unemployment rate is rising. Slovenian entrepreneur Miha Pšenica from [Mihov.com](https://www.mihov.com/) has come to an idea to use open mapping data of Slovenian enterprises and information of jobs available at Institute of Employment. The company has linked the two and created a database free to use for the citizens of Slovenia. But a problem arose when the Institute of Employment changed its method of publicised data. It could no longer be transferred and linked. So, the question of consistency was posed to Opsi hub, the organization responsible for open data in Slovenia.","Open data is important. Open data should be used and should be available on many levels. At the end of the day, we concluded that we spend thousands of Euros for creating apps for the better goods of the citizens, but we forget that the real value comes from the use itself. Therefore, the solution needs to be communicated properly and loudly enough to reach the end user. Only in this way can the solution get the right value and usability. 

We have also learned that open data should be in the format that can be reused for better good. And last but not least we learned that the key to open data is digital trust, the free flow of non-personal data and that personal data should be properly secured.",Not many are aware of the power of open data. Not many use it.

For three weeks, participants worked intensely on analyzing the first dataset published in Costa Rica under the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS). The dataset includes 12,491 contracting processes managed by the Supreme Court of Justice covering the period from January 2016 to October 2020.

The event involved the following:

• 100 participants from 10 universities
• 30 interuniversity and multidisciplinary teams
• 10 Data Science Workshops facilitated by INTEL specialists
• 2,400+ Slack messages
• 40+ social media review posts #DataChallengeULACIT

The competition had a kickoff session on March 6 (Open Data Day). For three weeks, the teams worked on a notebook where they documented their analysis procedures. Most of the teams focused on use cases associated with promoting greater competition and transparency in public procurement processes. Five finalist teams presented their results to a jury made up of specialists in data analysis and representatives of the Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica.","For many of the participants, it was their first opportunity to analyse a real dataset. They also discovered the enormous potential of open data for developing educational, social, and professional projects.

For representatives from academia and industry, the competition demonstrated the enormous potential of local youth in data science and analytics.

For public officials, the event was an excellent opportunity to observe how real users interact with open contracting data. The publication of these sets on the open data portal can be improved by adding direct references to the OCDS documentation and the local legislation applicable to contracts.","Open Data Day is an excellent opportunity to bring together people from diverse backgrounds to learn, share, create and imagine a better world based on data.",,data-challenge-take-advantage-of-the-first-dataset-published-under-the-ocds-in,CST,https://www.ulacit.ac.cr/,AMER,The Americas
Costa Rica,2021-03-06,Data Expedition - Costa Rica,/images/2021/data-expedition-costa-rica,"Identify, explore, visualise and disclose key facts about projects being implemented by Territorial Rural Development Councils. This will be the goal of the Data Expedition that we will be doing in conjunction with the Instituto de Desarrollo Rural, Inder",/events/2021/reports/data-expedition-costa-rica/,15:00,https://twitter.com/accesaorg/status/1368358430638026754,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nq7SZmlx7nw,True,10.0783206,-84.4769455,ILDA,True,30,True,https://www.facebook.com/ACCESA.ORG/posts/1389567931381606,ACCESA,La Union,"Our event this year had a peculiarity, which was that the data we wanted to use wasn’t actually open. To give a little background: we are the civil society counterparts of the Social Inclusion commitment included in [Costa Rica’s Open State Action Plan](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Costa-Rica_Action-Plan_2019-2022_Revised_EN.pdf), which aims to support the [Territorial Councils of Rural Development](https://www.inder.go.cr/territorios/index.aspx), the main participatory bodies for fostering rural development in the country, so that they can be more transparent, open and inclusive. But on the course of this work we found a very important stumbling block: the data about the projects these Councils are implementing was not accessible anywhere.

Leveraging the fact that Open Data Day was approaching, we asked the [Institute for Rural Development (Inder)](https://www.inder.go.cr/) - the public institution that assists and partly finances the Councils - if they had this data because we were interested in holding an event to disseminate the important work being done by the Councils. They were kind to share the data with us, but the file they gave us was not exactly ready for public consumption, so we had to do quite a bit of work to clean the data and present it in a way that was more clear and attractive to people.

For our event, we designed a Data Expedition where the participants were able to access and explore for the first time ever the data of the projects being implemented by the Councils, their location, the money spent on them, their percentage of completion, the organisations involved and many other key info that was previously undisclosed. It should be mentioned that none of this data was confidential, it just hadn’t been made available. But the great thing about Open Data Day is that it gave us the impetus to change that situation and demonstrate how data can be used to improve and monitor rural development.","Our Open Data Day celebration, which usually takes place in a physical space, had to forcibly be relocated to a virtual environment this year because of the pandemic. This brought with it a series of challenges regarding how to translate the experience of a Data Expedition to an online setting in which we cannot interact face-to-face with the participants.

One of the main challenges had to do with time: people do not have the same endurance sitting in front of their computer on a videoconference than they do in an in-person activity. So we had to reduce the scope of the event, which meant that time was too short to fully explore and follow through on any hypothesis or relationships that may be identified, but it at least planted the seeds for further data exploration. 

We also found out that many of the people in the event were there as observers: very interested to learn about the data being made available, but not with the conditions or inclinations to actively participate. Therefore, we successfully repurposed the event to this situation, focusing more on presenting the reports and visualisations that we prepared, explaining the possibilities for further use of the data, and answering any questions or comments that participants wanted to share with us.","We love Open Data Day because, as an organisation that aims to transform the relationship between governments and citizens, it is an excellent opportunity to prompt public institutions to open their data and share it with the people, so that through the different activities that are planned throughout the day both governments and citizens can understand the potential of open data and collaborate to reach better solutions to our common problems.","One of the most important outcomes of this event was the opening and publication of data that was previously closed and unpublished. Not only that, but the work we did in cleaning the data and visualising it using maps will go a long way in allowing the Councils and anyone else to harness its potential for rural development. 

For now the data is only available in our [Tableau Public account](https://public.tableau.com/profile/accesa#!/), but in the coming months we’ll work with Inder and the Councils to ensure that this data can be more widely-disseminated and used in ways that can foster the transparency, inclusiveness and decision-making process of the Councils.",data-expedition-costa-rica,CST,http://accesa.org/,AMER,The Americas

The eight-hour training trained the students the basics in data journalism by explaining in detail the concept of open data, how to scrap and clean data to create open data, laws regulating data journalism in Tanzania, data analysis, data visualisation and how to develop data-driven stories from open data for radio, TV, newspapers and online platforms. 

The training was a unique opportunity to the students since they got a chance to learn and practise new skills that can make them competitive in the current job market after finishing their studies.

Conducting such training with students was a stepping stone to creating better journalists who can add value in their reporting and producing content that can impact lives in future.
","One of the foremost lessons learnt from the students is that data journalism is not taught completely in colleges or universities offering journalism or mass communication courses in Tanzania. Nearly all the lessons were new to the students and they acknowledged that the opportunity gave them exposure and the skills were key in building their careers after school.

At Nukta Africa we learnt that there are useful open data dashboards by the government and other stakeholders which are not commonly used and known to most people. Also, former famous open data dashboards like opendata.go.tz are no longer available to the public. Therefore, conducting these training makes people aware and informed on data that could help them in business, reporting and decision making.

Furthermore, emphasis on maximising the use of open data in the community through data journalism is one the best way to utilise the resources available. Open data dashboards may not yield expected results if journalists cannot use the data to find stories relevant to their community. Data-driven stories with contexts from ground reporting has proved to be more effective in increasing transparency and by accounting people in power.

Nikesh Balami, CEO/co-founder of Open Knowledge Nepal, started the event by welcoming all the individuals and oriented on the tentative goal of the gathering. He highlighted the core values of coming together as a community and contributing to the common goal. The gathering was more of an informal collaborative forum, and it was rightly highlighted by Arogya Koirala from Kathmandu Living Labs. He opined the need for developing a peer learning and collaborative open community rather than a top-down approach of coaching the participants. It was interesting to note, how all participants passively agreed to the notion of more informal, open peer-based learning in community settings.

After the introduction session, the event free flowed. Everyone worked on what best fits the goal of the event, as per their expertise and through collaboration. Some of the works included:
- Solving bugs in the ‘Open Data Nepal’ portal.
- Developing a data scraper for scraping the data such that it would be convenient to convert it in open format.
- Brainstorming for the designing logo of Air Quality Nepal bot (currently available on Twitter).
- Refining data from the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board.
- Researching on government portals and other relevant organizations, discovering useful climate and environment data, making it open and uploading it in the Open Data Nepal’s portal.

We generated participation and collaboration from the different actors making use of open data, and resources in technological platforms. But the impact in terms of number of attendees was not what we expected.

We found an opportunity for improvement and realised that we should have spent more time generating a media and marketing plan in advance to aim for greater coverage for the central region of Colombia, in all the social media, radio media and local newspapers.

The fund and sponsorship from civil society, and alliances with other social organisations are also important.","On Open Data Day, we want to celebrate as civil society that is important the knowledge democracy, not only for adult citizens, but also for children and adolescents across the region.

Also, the children can benefit from using and leveraging open data, as by analysing data on their math and science (STEM) performance, for example, all stakeholders can make decisions to improve the education quality.

[GeOsm](http://geosm.org/) is an open source geospatial data portal, 100% African, scalable on all administrative units and based on - but not only on - the OpenStreetMap free database. 

We celebrated the day by gathering several actors of the digital ecosystem, namely a representative of the OSM Foundation, students, professionals from the ministries of urban planning and housing and local development, researchers and the GeOsm team. There were a total of 20 participants.

The event took place on March 12 2021 in the premises of GeOsm, beginning at 11am and ending at 2pm. The exchanges were focused on the development of an open source solution from open data.

[GeOsm](http://geosm.org/) is the solution presented which today is deployed in 21 countries and at the communal level in eight cities of North Cameroon and six of south-west Cameroon under the title [Geocommunal](http://limbe.geosm.org/map).

We presented:
- The reasons why we decided to use free data and to make our platform an open source namely the fact of being able to allow each contributor to use and modify its core and in return make valuable improvements.
- We also discussed its various functionalities and the potential instances to be set up to meet the needs listed by local collectivities to improve the management of their resources, such as geofiscal for fiscality and geotourism for tourism.

It was also the occasion to cement the partnership between the OSM Foundation and GeOsm through the signing of a trademark license agreement.

A brainstorming session was also held among the participants, who were able to give their perception of the use of data. They then congratulated the project and the signing of the agreement, which will further facilitate access to information and decision-making.","Open data gives the possibility to bring everyone to the building. Tt allows the symbiosis and the sharing of the individual efforts that have become common. It allows to reach the objectives more quickly and to solve the problems in an effective and efficient way. Each contributor has then the possibility to take advantage of the data created by the community of contributors and to use it to develop innovative and useful solutions for the local development of his country. This is the case of the GeOsm team, which has offered the possibility to the users of the platform to benefit from a direct access to the free data and a way to solve the problems they encounter.","Because it is an opportunity to celebrate open data, to exchange on the value of free data, on the interest to produce it, to create a symbiosis between the efforts and the added value linked to the availability of data.",,geoevangelisation-workshop-in-the-use-of-josm-and-geosm-the-first-100-african,WAT,http://geosm.org,EMEA,"Europe, Middle East & Africa"

The theme for the event was, ‘Leveraging data on abuse of female journalists in Ghana to promote equal development within the digital ecosystem in Africa,’ and was joined by over 40 participants across the continent.

Co-founder of iWatch Africa, Moro Seidu delivered a presentation with focus on the current data on abuse of women journalists in Ghana. Moro stressed that “although the introduction of social media has enhanced communication and participation on social media platforms, it has not been friendly on the female gender.”

Moro cited iWatch Africa 2020 data which showed that while the number of male journalists monitored were three times more than their female counterparts, 46 per cent of the total number of online abuses recorded by iWatch Africa were directed at women journalists in Ghana.

Second speaker, Nashilongo Gervaslus blamed the patriarchal upbringing in many homes across the continent for the sort of accountability which treats women with a different sort of lens and opens them up to abuse. She recommended that governments across the continent introduce cyber-crime legislation to protect women online.

Our final speaker Sheilah Birgen, also stressed the need for newsrooms to provide support for female journalists and protect them against online misogyinistic mobs. Sheilah also argued that, “the stigma relating to these abuses deters some women from speaking about it.”

The event ended with a resolution led by Gideon Sarpong, to work on mainstreaming digital rights units in 50 newsrooms in West Africa to mitigate the risks that online harassment of women journalists poses to the press freedom and equal development within the digital ecosystem in Africa.",More work need to be done to gather data on abuse of women journalists online across Africa.,It helps deepen transparency and accountability in Africa.,,leveraging-data-on-abuse-of-female-journalists-to-promote-equal-development-with,GMT,,EMEA,"Europe, Middle East & Africa"

The webinar brought together 50 participants on Zoom platform and over 100 views on YouTube. The webinar featured youthful speakers who actively rely on open data sources for their typical work. The panelist was drawn from both the public and private sector institutions including; The Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis, Standard Group PLC, Dalberg Consulting Group, and the National Youth Council. 

The theme of the discussion included progress made in enhancing data availability and access for use in sustainable policy development; opportunities for open data in advancing the national and international development agenda; experience of non-state actors in leveraging existing data sources; challenges in utilizing existing data and research in youth advocacy; and possible mitigation measures to enhance uptake of data and research. The webinar created awareness of the opportunities to use open data for local content development in Kenya. 

The webinar featured practical open data mining sessions that sensitised the participants of the different national and international websites that host open data day. This was demonstrated through a PowerPoint presentation and live data mining on KNBS and the World Bank open data sites.  

As part of our campaign to commemorate Open Data Day we also published an article in today’s issue of Standard Media Group LLC on Data as an Asset for Water Management 

The Webinar ended with call for action on four thematic areas which include: 
- Open data to respond to #changing dynamics of data needs
- Incentivise private sector models for data collection 
- Data disaggregation to fit smaller unit decision making 
- Promote data journalism in Kenya","Currently, there’s limited conversation between the producers of the data, and those in demand of the data – private and development sector, thus the open data collection is not always informed by market needs. Going forward, the consumer (general public, private sector, and development sector) data needs ought to inform decisions on what open data is collected. 

There is need to incentivise the private sector to stimulate private sector models for data collection to ensure that the open data is timely and substantive. Leveraging the private sector would enable the adoption of innovations in data management such as data science and data engineering. Moreover, it’s essential to have the open data packaged in easily consumable formats by the diverse stakeholders. 

Given that journalists convey open data and its social-economic implications to the general public, data journalism becomes an integral component in the capacity building of journalists. Thus the need for data journalism to sensitize the journalist on local open data sources. This could be done through government and private sector partnerships. Additionally, non-profit organisations such as 254 Youth Policy Café could take a role in sensitising local journalists on data sources in Kenya.",Commemorating Open Data Day gave 254 Youth Policy Café team an opportunity to capacity build youths in Kenya on mining open data to use it for research that informs policy recommendations.,,leveraging-open-data-as-an-asset-for-inclusive-and-sustainable-development,EAT,,EMEA,"Europe, Middle East & Africa"

We aim to increase representation and participation of women and LGBTQIA+ in the open mapping platform - OpenStreetMap - to generate open data with and for local communities.","Here are some lessons learned shared by the participants and organising team:

*A. Participants*

- The talk promoted safe space and open discussions. I loved the lightning talks especially #TransWomenAreWomen and being in the tech industry because it clarified a lot of things (esp. with the myths) and I was also inspired by Ms Marion's talk on building a credible resume that no discrimination can ever ignore it.
- It inspired me to pursue and slowly start mapping here in my community esp. with the quote mentioned earlier that goes something about ""the places that are less mapped are less accessed"" and seeing myself having a hard time navigating in my own community during the mapathon. Months earlier I was hesitant on starting (while attending a lot of mapping events online) but during #mapababae2021, I gained little confidence to start (and I hope it will be flames this 2021).
- I learned about the importance of women's perspective in mapping - everyone has different perspectives and they are equally important on the map
- It's about mapping for the LGBT. it is very important that every individual has the access to every facilities without discrimination
- Through the experiences of the speakers, I've been inspired to map more for the community
- This is really new to me and I'm happy to learn new techniques in mapping LGBTQI friendly spaces

*B. Organising Team (on logistics, etc)*

- Delivery of tokens and prizes to participants took more time and difficulty as logistical options are very costly and time consuming - maybe provide digital vouchers, etc
- Challenging coordination as various channels were required for partner organisations - be firm in setting up one channel only
- Improve on marketing and getting partners to increase reach and attendance from participants",We love Open Data Day because we want to celebrate communities for whom and with whom open data are made.,,mapababae-2021-choosetochallenge-gender-inequality-in-open-mapping,PST,https://www.facebook.com/geoladiesph,APAC,Asia & The Pacific

We chose this project as it has been one of the biggest projects initiated by the current government to overcome climate change but at the same time had been under scrutiny due to corruption allegations. 

The event started with the team evaluating the available data in the monitoring report published by WWF (third party). After understanding the datasets and their correlations, the team came up with a plan to share a consolidated dataset containing the location data of nurseries and the total number of tree saplings sown in the area. With this subset of data, the team was only able to map around 12.6% of the total trees planted (1 billion) as the rest of the information (number of plantation) was not published in the report. The motivation behind working on this subset of data was to publish something meaningful for the developers as well as plotting the available data on a map to make it understandable for the public. 

The team was divided into three parts. The first team was responsible for segregating and cleaning the datasets, the second team combined the data from different tables, processed it, and converted it into a machine-readable format and the third team worked on a public-facing dashboard where these coordinates were to be mapped.

At the end of the event, the team was able to publish the dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/aliirz/billion-tree-tsunami) as well as the map of all the coordinates through ArcGIS (https://arcg.is/1jmbjm). This proof of concept will now be shared with relevant government agencies working on the climate and environment to open further datasets that can make this initiative more transparent and accountable.","Play smart: To get started with an open data project, there is already tons of data available online in legacy formats that can be used. This data can be in the form of PDF reports either published by the agencies themselves or by third parties.

Gain trust: This raw data can be used to develop a proof of concept and can then be shared with the relevant agencies to get them excited. The proof of concept can also be handed over to the agencies to explore other possibilities.

Open data: Once these agencies see value in opening up the data and how it can be used to achieve their organisational goals, they will come on board and provide access to the required data. That is where the real magic happens!",It is always a pleasure to see so many like-minded people coming together to show the importance of open data and how can it be used to fight the biggest challenges being faced by the public sector across the globe.

For the first event, we focused on the role of investigative journalists and civil society in that matter (e.g. we introduced the Opener application, developed by Estonian and Latvian NGOs in cooperation with governmental stakeholders). 

Later in the second event, we engaged different governmental stakeholders and local administrations as well as civil society to learn about the possibilities for re-using publically available payment data of the public sector. The event’s goal was to encourage the re-use of payment data for the early detection of potential conflicts of interest and raise the participants’ data visualisations skills.

Payment data from the public sector: [https://saldo.rtk.ee/saldo-app/](https://saldo.rtk.ee/saldo-app/)","The main lessons of the events were that data journalism is still in its infancy in Estonia. More effort needs to be invested in the capacity building of journalists in that matter. There are also many challenges for more accessible investigations, sometimes due to the intentional use of legislation for restricting access to certain information and data (even if the legitimate reasons for it are debatable). Furthermore, there is relatively low awareness about where particular information and data could be found, and how accessible these are. 

With that in mind, our event hopefully contributed to raising awareness on the subject, and we’ll keep working on it in the future. In the second event, we learned that, although publically available payment data is not yet available in a machine-readable format, the relevant stakeholders are putting significant effort into making that available later this spring. People who are issuing payment data to the government are eager to see what applications will be built based on it, while they still seem sceptical about its impact. Concrete use cases need to be built, which would in turn, show them the impact of open data more clearly.","As for most of the society, data “just happens” without consciously thinking about it, it’s great to take a collective moment to appreciate all the efforts put into making our societies more data-driven, transparent and open. All the events and smaller celebratory activities made during the Open Data Day shows the collective wish to work towards these values.","We did not make any pictures from the event, but the two presentation from the first event are accessible here (in Estonian):

From 3:30am to 11am, we collected plastic and other litter from the coastal mangroves. 398kg of trash was collected and sent to the recycling centre. Items collected included; plastic bottles, plastic bags, tie-tie, sandals, shoes, clothes, tyres, mosquito nets and glass bottles. 

The event then was followed by a short dialogue on the importance of volunteerism in generating quality data. This dialogue was facilitated by Ms Asma Ahmada Hamad (ZAVECO) and Mrs Raya Idrissa Ahmada (SUZA)

At last students got the opportunity to observe biodiversity associated with mangrove forests. Mr Iddi Hassan Ali (ZAVECO) guided students through the mangrove ecosystem to let them explore the real world, linking theories and practices. We would like to express our gratitude to the Open Knowledge Foundation for their support.","Through volunteerism, we can collect quality data and make them freely accessible to those in need. Local NGOs run by local communities often lack access to funding for this kind of work but can partner with students in collecting quality, timely and relevant data to help make informed decisions about their projects. In this manner, students can gain useful work experience before entering formal employment and it could be a chance to innovate to solve more societal problems.","It gives an opportunity for people to understand more about the accessibility of the data and importance of the data and challenges in collection, management and uses.","ZAVECO - in collaboration with the regional YouthMappers ambassador - plan to establish a volunteerism programme for final year students.

Organised to mark Open Data Day, the event had the goal of raising awareness to the Congolese community - especially the women’s rights community - on the use of open data in defending the women’s accessibility to employment.

The event’s activities consisted of paying attention to the open data contribution in increasing the women’s accessibility to employment and helping foster balance between men and women in the professional world.

During the event’s activities, both the women and men attending the event’s activities analysed factors that hinders women’s accessibility to employment locally.

As most job offers are now published over the internet, participants deplored the lack of necessary knowledge of women about how to find jobs through the internet. Furthermore, the weak internet penetration in hard-to-reach areas exacerbates this situation as most of women didn’t know about the existence of platforms for job offers.

In response to this challenge, the event’s facilitator shared two local platforms for job offers - Julisha.cd and MediaCongo.net - and job offer data was exploited in teaching them how to find a local job offer.

After the project’s completion, participants were able to;
• Search employment data from local platforms and share them to women’s networks in order to reach out to them who need them
• Subscribe to the job platform to get timely job alerts
At the end of the activities, participants promised to advocate for the simplification of the conditions in treating and analysing the job documents submitted by the women.","Open Data Day made us understand how important is to spread the open data concept in the under-reported world. Thanks to the open data concept, community from rural areas in Africa can also have an up-to-date overwiew on how the world is moving and better prepare in every mutation the world is facing.","Open Data Day is an occasion for communities to demand more accountability, transparency andopacity on all social economic sectors.

Things kicked off with a welcoming session from the Youthmappers vice president, followed by a short speech from a representative of the SUZA students organisation. This session was followed by a short presentation about Open Data Day, [Youthmappers](https://www.youthmappers.org/) and the EverywhereSheMaps initiative by Mrs Raya Ahmada, SUZA Youthmappers mentor and regional ambassador.

The first speaker, Jamila Mdungi, a Resilience Academy Intern and SUZA Youthmappers alumni, started with an Introduction to GIS.

The next speaker, Asya Juma, talked about the [Geonode](https://geonode.resilienceacademy.ac.tz/), a climate risk database. Asya is also an RA intern and SUZA Youthmappers committee member. She introduced the importance of supporting research, education and disaster-risk management practices.

The sessions were followed by data visualisations presented by three SUZA Youthmappers members and alumni, all of which are females. Some of the data visualisations showed [flood risk assessments based on waste collection points near the drainage system in Zanzibar](https://jrbshariff.github.io/geo-Visualization/) and the [Zanzibar waste collection atlas](https://alikombo.github.io/myatlas/).

Mr. Yussuf from [Tanzania Flying Labs](https://flyinglabs.org/tanzania/) then finished with the discussion on drones and AI.

The event finished with a surprise gift from SUZA Youthmappers students to their mentor to show appreciation of the support they get from her. A wall clock with SUZA Youthmappers logo and the mentor name was printed on the display.","The event gave the students from SUZA and other universities the chance to learn more about open data and the GIS skills. It also gave us a room to transfer knowledge from students who have the skills to those who are new to the field. 

Mr. Yussuf, a computer science graduate at SUZA, was a vivid example as he is now working with drones at Tanzania Flying Labs. Most of the presented data visualisations were also prepared by the students from the department of computer science and IT. So it is not only about collecting data, but also producing meaningful stories from existing data.

The date marked the beginning of a discussion with various sectors of the city and beyond about transparency in the city, its problems and opportunities.

Feira is a city that, unfortunately, is marked by a lack of government transparency. There is a lack of knowledge both by the citizens about their rights to have access to any public data and by the public authorities about the benefits of opening their data and letting society participate in solving problems.

Thinking about the local reality, we organised two round tables: the first one about transparency as public policy and the second one about open science. In the first, we discussed the role of transparency in the creation of public policies and its impact on popular participation. We were attended by members of the press, public agencies and activists. A councilman also participated in the panel. In the second we talked about open science, a theme that has become even more relevant during the pandemic of the new coronavirus. We had the presence of researchers from the region and from renowned institutions such as FIOCRUZ.

Besides the round tables, we also organised a hackathon to analyze the city's data, aiming to encourage the exploration of data that the open data project of Feira has been collecting.

The event was 100% online and can be followed on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx0zm7IFCou6_L43PoZBOq1e4lgK3ccH9). Photos and videos can be seen [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/mskUV3MVZsGc4PAEA).

The organisation was done by Dados Abertos de Feira, a civil society initiative that advocates for transparency in Feira de Santana, and the Graduate Program in Computer Science from the State University of Feira de Santana.","The most relevant thing we learned was that collaboration is essential to advance any agenda. By bringing together a civil society activist group and researchers, we can address the same theme within the needs of each group.

We also learned about the needs that exist regarding data. We had almost 30 teams signed up for the hackathon, but only one delivered. When we approached the teams to understand the reasons for dropping out, we realized that two reasons were essential: 1) the deadline was short (two days) and 2) a lot of data that the participants wanted to explore is not available.

Understanding more about the data and the limitations in data exploration will help us guide the actions of the Feira Open Data initiative and what collaborations can be made in the future to make data more accessible in the city of Feira de Santana.","How couldn't I? :) It's amazing to have one international day, where we can celebrate the goal of making the world more transparent.

The speakers of the workshops explained how to search, analyse, and visualise data using various tools. 

At the online conference on March 6, we invited Russian and international experts to discuss various topics related to open data. The discussions were attended by representatives of government departments, corporations, non-profit organizations, and open data activists.

The programme included the following discussions:
•        Business based on open data and open source 
•        Open data ratings and reports. How they influence the openness of the state?
•        Availability of public finance data in Russia 
•        2021 census data in Russia: privacy vs social benefits 
•        What's going on with openness in the world?

The final session was held in English and was attended by Jeremy Rollison, Senior Director European Government Affairs Microsoft; Godfrey Takavarasha Data Manager at Humanitarian Data Exchange; Sarkis Darbinyan, Managing partner of the Digital Rights Center; Ivan Begtin, Director NGO «Infoculture». You can watch the video on our YouTube channel [https://youtu.be/TdaVSCQZ_V4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdaVSCQZ_V4) ","In recent years, we can see that governments around the world have started to publish fewer data and rethink openness policies. And as the speakers of the conference confirmed, this is not only a Russian problem, it happens in many countries.

Openness now faces various challenges:
• Search for successful models of data reuse for public benefit. In this process, the collaboration between government, NGOs, researchers, and citizens is especially important.
• Searching a balance between openness and privacy of citizens, protection of personal data.
• Improving the quality of published data etc.
 
Sometimes it seems that taking two steps forward, we then take a step back. But we are still moving in a more open direction. And we are constantly looking for answers and solutions to the challenges facing open data.","NGO «Infoculture» is the largest organisation in Russia that develops and promotes open data. Every year we organise events to celebrate Open Data Day. For us, this is a great opportunity to meet with experts and the Russian open data community, to discuss what is going on with open data, exchange opinions, plan common projects and plans.

A panel of local experiences sought to present success stories from each city related to the use, reuse and / or publication of open data for citizen benefit, as well as the challenges that lie ahead at the local level. In addition to this, the event held a series of workshops focused on the use of environmental data, a topic that is of common interest to most citizens of León. 

Workshops:

1) Open data, analyzing data on air quality and its pollutants
2) Open source, data collection of trees and native species in the urban environment
3) Open mapping, visualizing water management infrastructure

We used open source tools to gather, process and view data in order to co-design solutions as well as to raise awareness about environmental issues. This was possible thanks to the collaboration of:

The importance of environmental data and its availability is crucial, this allows us to make better policies and ensure that the appropriate actions are taken.

The involvement of the government in conjunction with the private sector and civil society allows greater openness to create solutions that benefit everyone.","Because it is a collaborative space that allows us to show the benefits of open data and encourage the adoption of open data policies in government, companies and civil society to solve common problems in our communities.","An open source web app was created that allowed participants to gather information on trees and native species of the city to be mapped collaboratively.

In February 2020, we planted some mangrove trees to mitigate climate change and encourage reforestation in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria where these mangroves suffer massive deforestation occasioned by activities of oil/gas companies cutting down these mangrove plants to access land sites for their oil/gas extraction. Oil spill soon follows from the consequences of their activities, destroying the ecosystem and micro inhabitants that the host communities rely on for livelihoods and socio-economic vitality. This year at our Open Data Day event we teach the students of Ignatius Ajuru University in Rivers State Nigeria and our mangroves ambassadors on how to use the Forest Watcher app and the Global Forest Watch web tools to collect data and monitor mangrove loss and gain in on project sites ",/events/2021/reports/open-data-day-port-harcourt-2021/,12:00,https://twitter.com/SammyJoelNG/status/1368297876770746372,,True,34.36155,-89.5022,GFDRR,True,50,False,,Niger Delta Snapshot #SaveNigerianMangroves,"Port Harcourt, Rivers State","Our International Open Data Day 2021 brought environmental activists, environmental data enthusiasts, students and our mangrove ambassadors to celebrate, promote and spread the use of open data in our communities. 
It was an opportunity for us to show the benefits of using open data to uncover hidden threats destructive to Nigeria's mangroves and demonstrate the necessity for urgent action to save the mangrove ecosystem. 

The first facilitator was Mr. Sammy Joel who spoke on the topic: INTRODUCTION TO OPEN DATA where he explained the description of terms and concepts related to open data and why the international Open Data Day 2021 was being celebrated here in Nigeria. 

The second speaker Mr Kingsley Adindu spoke about the overview of the Niger Delta Mangroves and how its socio-economic vitality is key to the survival of host communities and the entire coastal region. He lamented the poor availability of adequate and reliable data for decision-making and policy formulation on environmental problems facing the region. 

The third presentation was made by Mr Sammy Joel who vividly introduced the audience to the open data technologies used to track forest loss/gain and how it can be deployed to solve environmental hitches particularly those relating to that of mangrove deforestation in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. 

The tools mentioned were the FOREST WATCHER MOBILE APP and FOREST WATCHER WEB from the open data portal of the GLOBAL FOREST WATCH. The technologies are an online flat-form that provides data sets and tools for monitoring forest in real-time. Mr Sammy also did some forest data visualisation to participants using datasets from the Global Forest Watch open data portal. We decided to use the Forest Watcher app to collect data for monitoring mangrove loss/gain on our project site using the open data platform.","The big lessons learned from this event were that “DATA IS KEY TO DECISION MAKING “and inadequate data constitutes principal drawbacks to policy formulation and decision-making concerning the forest ecosystem and its inhabitants (host communities). 

Secondly, lack of information regarding forest protection laws and political will of people living within forest regions, wetland and coastal areas is a barrier that hinders progress from biodiversity conservation and environmental protection in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Hence the need to prioritise these valuable open data technologies and datasets to help gain actionable insights.",I love the Open Data Day because it gives me the opportunity for knowledge sharing with my community and helps me to demonstrate the urgency of the climate emergency and a call to save Nigeria mangroves.,,open-data-day-port-harcourt-2021,WAT,https://mangrovemarathon.org/,EMEA,"Europe, Middle East & Africa"

Representants of the open data community who were invited to conduct talks and workshops have revealed their knowledge through speaking and demonstrating tools and interacting with the audience. 

There were activities all day, and the live sessions were transmitted on YouTube. Over 70 people participated in the morning and around 40 people in each workshop in the afternoon. The recording of the three sessions is already available and reached, together, around 450 views in the same weekend that #ODDPOA2021 occurred. 

In the morning, Georg Neumann (Open Contracting Partnership) presented information on what citizens should pay attention to when monitoring public contracts, especially in Covid-19 times, once emergencies have the potential to increase corruption risk. 

After his talk, five panelists presented their projects on the discussion “Investigating public spending through open data and the Access to Information Law.”. Maria Vitória Ramos (Fiquem Sabendo) explained how to use the Access of Information Law to uncover military pensions data. Álvaro Justen and Reinaldo Chaves (Cruza Grafos) demonstrated how to combine information about politicians and business partner companies to investigate corruption. Jonas Coelho (Transparência Brasil) showed a specialized project to monitor the public contracting of food to be distributed in schools. Fernando Barbalho (Secretaria do Tesouro Nacional) presented several public databases to consult the national and local government budget to Covid-19 expenses. The session was coordinated by Luciana Kraemer (Unisinos). 

In the afternoon, the event offered two workshops. Juliana Rodrigues (Unisinos) explained the public budget’s main elements, while Felipe Soares (UFRGS) demonstrated how to use network analysis to comprehend disinformation involving politicians and other public agents. Both sessions were coordinated by Marília Gehrke (Afonte Jornalismo de Dados). 

Open Data Day Porto Alegre was organized by Marília Gehrke and Taís Seibt (Afonte Jornalismo de Dados). It was supported by Open Knowledge Foundation, Open Contracting Partnership, and Unisinos.

","Collaboration is required to create significant initiatives inside the open data community. People rarely have all the abilities to run a project only by themselves. It was evident in our opening panel: the five participants have known each other from before, mainly due to previous work. All of them have different backgrounds. The panelists also discussed the importance of offering an open-sourced and well-documented code to allow the public to scrutinize and reuse it in other projects. 

Besides, the participants have highlighted the importance of demonstrating tools that help in public monitoring. Brazil has one of the highest number of deaths due to Covid-19, and it is paramount to comprehend public databases and contracts to monitor public attitudes to cope with the pandemic. For instance, the panelists have presented information on checking the amount of money spent by the national government in cities and states. 

Furthermore, it was challenging to organize an online event this year and still guarantee an engaging schedule. Simultaneously, we were able to invite panelists from different parts of the country, and the audience was not geographically limited. In this regard, it was an opportunity to expand open data beyond Porto Alegre. 
","What I love the most about Open Data Day is the opportunity to meet people with different backgrounds and discuss relevant topics with a collaborative community. In general, people who celebrate Open Data Day do not just expect transparency from the government but also make significant changes in society. In the past years, I have learned that a person, alone, hardly executes a project. Through networking and cooperation, though, it is highly possible to play a significant role in society.",[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jaM7CxwaoI5k8U3LmRM2SRg7ArhBqIst_Oe1fIreDec/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jaM7CxwaoI5k8U3LmRM2SRg7ArhBqIst_Oe1fIreDec/edit),open-data-day-porto-alegre,BRT,https://afonte.info/2021/02/03/oddpoa2021/,AMER,The Americas

Sahili Franco Cipriani, editor, producer and translator, moderated the activity and introduced the speakers. Then, she lead the space for Indhira Libertad Rodríguez (who spoke about the contextualization of violence in Venezuela and Latin America under an intersectional and gender justice perspective), militant part of the Red de Colectivos La Araña Feminista, who was our special guest. After, Aimee Zambrano Ortiz, founder of the femicide monitor, introduced the monitor and shared our data and methodology. After, Sahili intervened with the importance of feminist data and the relation between gender and social science, and finally we opened the floor for questions and answers, which lasted almost 40 minutes. The debate was exquisite. Our webinar lasted 1hr and 59 minutes.

For the promotion of the event we published [an entry on our website](https://utopix.cc/anexos/open-data-day-monitoreando-femicidios-en-venezuela-con-utopix/). Then, we designed a flyer and shared it through Whatsapp, Facebook and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CL5T6iMB7Vl/) along a [Google Registration form](https://forms.gle/vwj7rB3U8NHs7dPb8) so participants could register and we could gather info regarding who was interested: we asked for names, emails, countries, how had they known of the activity and if they wanted to be part our mail list. Then, a day before the event, we shared the Zoom link with the 77 registered persons from Latin America, America and the US. Of that total, 23 participated in the webinar and by the time we were done, 21 were in the room, most of them form Venezuela. The number remained throughout the whole session. The link on the Facebook page has more than 400 views.","What we’ve learned:
1) Promote the event widely in advance. We did it with less than a week from the event.
2) Centralise and optimise the automatic mail response with the Zoom link after people have registered. MailChimp is our best choice so far, as it’s the engine we use in our website. Sending emails with the event link manually is exhausting and has a human error range.
3) Ask for phone numbers in the registration form as it helps to send a reminder of the event.
4) Hosting the event through Zoom (or other platform) in parallel with YouTube or Facebok is definitely a great idea; afterwards we have a secure link for sharing our event so people can watch it.
5) The moderator cannot be a panelist as well. Although it was a success, it worked because there were twenty or so people in the room. If there had been more it would have been difficult to tend to both roles.","It was an amazing opportunity to not only share data across the globe, but to bring together people from different localities and countries in a single space and share knowledge and points of view regarding gender-based violence in its femicide form, the situation in Latin America, and how we have been working to shift the world.

The [second workshop](https://github.com/programminghistorian/opendataday-2021#bloque-2-visualizaci%C3%B3n-de-datos-abiertos-con-python--pandas--dash---jairo-melo) focused on data visualisation using Python. Participants learned how to critically analyse the origin and quality of the open data, and the possibilities that Python offers to make significant data-driven narratives to highlight pressing issues in our region, like educational enrolment in Colombia.","Maybe the most important lesson learned was the relevance of this kind of event. Not only because it allowed us to identify pressing issues regarding education in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic (gender inequalities, access to technology, etc.) and education enrolment, but also because it showed the need of workshops where people can learn tools and techniques to analyse open data using open software.","Open Data Day is an event that allows us to build a community of practice and highlight pressing issues in our region (Latin America), while learning new tools and techniques.","On our GitHub repository you will find all the resources we produced (datasets, code, Jupyter notebook, etc.): [https://github.com/programminghistorian/opendataday-2021](https://github.com/programminghistorian/opendataday-2021)",open-data-day-datos-abiertos-y-humanidades-digitales,CST,https://programminghistorian.org/,AMER,The Americas

The theme of the day was ‘Open Data Development in an age of social fissures, insecurity and COVID19 in rural Zimbabwe’, bringing together 50 participants from Chegumo, Musana, Bindura and Matepatepa.

The event was hosted in both virtual and physical formats with support of The Pelican Trust in Bindura, which brought together multiple stakeholders, locals and students, to empower them in advancing open data in this part of the world in a rural dynamic setting. The event started at 3pm with a theoretical session and ended with a practical workshop at 7pm. The theoretical high impact session was hosted to be shared with participants on the basic concept of open data, its importance, and how it could be accelerated across rural settings. This was demonstrated through a presentation from organisers, panel members and community stakeholders who shared examples of the impact of open data on government intermediaries, education and healthcare in strengthening citizen engagement and access to life saving techniques in the community. And the importance of the release of data sets.

Our event helped to encourage local participants to use open data for local content development in Zimbabwe, showing how data could be made available for everyone to use, especially government data.

The driving concept was resourcing technologies that could be used for smart visualisation of data and how data could be made available on a database for everyone to use to encourage development, social cohesion and innovative collaboration. We also discovered that most data has not been made accessible across rural Zimbabwe . In order to encourage innovation, transparency, and collaboration we need to advance the open data movement in Zimbabwe,The workshop empowered locals to use social media platforms to talk about their experiences, expand knowledge and broaden their networks about data and to share it for reuse. We also made them understand that research data must be made available for people to reuse and distributed for everyone to visualise it. We also empowered the participants on how they can make their data available socially, teaching participants that they can share data from social media to other communication platforms or social media platforms like WhatsApp as most participants and community citizens in the rural setting appeared to have access to WhatsApp groups and platforms.

The event was fun, informative and appreciated by every participant even with the technological glitches that we experienced throughout the day. The central takeaway from participants was their interest and engagement on issues relating to transparency and methods in supporting public oversight of government and helping to reduce corruption by enabling greater transparency at local levels.","This year, our theme centred on 'Open Data Development in an age of social fissures, insecurity and COVID-19 in rural Zimbabwe' and we learnt that data and information are still political tools that are used based on the benefits to stakeholders that use it as a pawn as and when they see fit, while also realising that the girl child is still marginalised when it comes to access to information that would benefit the development of communities and reduce the gender gap in regard to post-educational opportunities and training.

While we had interlooping hiccups for transmission of links we used to educate girls in other remote villages that had looked foward to a physical event and were sidelined due to travel restrictions, we found that YouTube remains an important window to the world when used correctly to educate communities as we did using:

[https://youtu.be/nkrhO2TkFqo](https://youtu.be/nkrhO2TkFqo)

We also learnt that as most rural communities are still moving away from cultural barriers that hinder acceptance, translation and understanding of the world events around them using videos and training tools that gave examples of other African countries appeared to give comfort in accepting the messages and training via video. In light of the lessons we have learnt that as civil society we still have a lot of work to be done in order to work with stakeholders locally to make access to data for all a basic human right for the greater good.","At Rausing (Zimbabwe), we love Open Data Day as we feel it is an important event and occasion to mark the importance of access to information and community-driven solutions globally in an age where data is often used as a represive tool that hinders development of marginalised communities across the world and especially rural communities where we work and see the effects of lack of access to data. We have also realised that this is an opportunity at grassroots level to showcase to community leaders and other relevant stakeholders the benefits of open data, while encouraging the adoption of open data policies in rural and local government, rural business spaces and rural community organisations.

COVID-19 has had a significant social and economic impact across vulnerable communities with misinformation, false news, lack of access to life saving news and procedures and protocols for enhancing health awareness techniques through global campaigns and we have managed to be a bridge to provide high impact applied learning, increase local skills and provision of capacity building tooling during this amazing day. We joined the 2021 annual event to promote awareness and use of open data in Mungofa Village using multiple activities that were conducted according to COVID-19 (WHO) guidelines that included a talk/seminar and digital demonstrations and data training. We also managed to meet the local chief whom we had extensive discussion and talks on data and information being important for all and the need for it to always available, free and accessible all the time.

In the first half of the workshop, Paul Schweizer from the [Kollektiv Orangotango](https://orangotango.info/), Erin McElroy from the [Anti-Eviction Mapping Project](https://antievictionmap.com/), as well as Kitti Baracsi presented their work with communities for progressive change, followed by a Q&A with the approximately 50 participants.

Paul showed how collective/critical cartography projects can show us perspectives, contexts, designs, uses and tools which are different from the dominant ones. Mapping practices in most of the cases also reveal new data about the world around us.

Erin’s intervention focused on their work on housing injustices in different regions of the world. Their projects made use of different kinds of data - from official records to crowdsourced data to oral history audiovisual material - to discuss current housing injustices and reveal possible ways of intervention.

Kitti’s presentation about her work with children and marginalized groups underlined that experiences, feelings, and personal stories of people are important elements which we may wish to collect, discuss and present, if we are thinking about future trajectories of urban neighbourhoods.

In the second part of the workshop a smaller group of participants (around 20 people) worked collectively in a [Miro](https://miro.com/) whiteboard, and discussed how gentrification changed urban environments around the world and especially in Budapest. Group discussion revolved around the questions of displacement, changing small commerce and people’s desires. Groups developed symbologies and mapped urban change due to gentrification in contemporary Budapest (see the attached photo) and shared existing community mapping projects from their context.","The event showed us how collective/critical cartography can help reveal social processes from macro-level processes on the global scale to micro-level processes on the scale of the human body. 

The presentations referred to a wide range of sources which can be mobilised in collective/critical mapping projects. A lesson learned is also that during such collaborative projects, it is sometimes the collaboration process itself which is the result of the map-making, in some cases a new understanding of the world around us, whereas in some cases co-created maps help us to develop collective action against dominant narratives and existing power structures. Mapping is a way of gaining ownership over data and using it for advocacy purposes.

Participants of the second half of the workshop emphasised that they learned that collective/critical mapping is a fruitful method in mobilising and revealing knowledges of communities they are working with; how powerful maps might be in presenting data; as well as how online tools and platforms offer us valuable alternatives for working with communities in times when personal meeting is not possible.","Open Data Day calls attention to co-creating, collecting and publishing open data for a broad range of audiences.",,open-data-for-critical-mapping-of-gentrification-in-hungary,CET,https://www.periferiacenter.com/,EMEA,"Europe, Middle East & Africa"

- What's next? : suggestion for Thailand's data governance structure, by a researcher and academic
- Understand Better! : PDPA (Personal Data Protection Act) and open data in Thailand, by a researcher and academic

The other session features 1-hour panel discussion. We invited 3 guest speakers from research institute (Siam Lab), civil organization (iLaw), and civic technology (ELECT) to discuss about open government. The topics include :
- What is open government and how does it deal with open data?
- How open data can support democracy in our country? And what's the problems now?
- What have we lost when we don’t have open data?
- What's our next expectation? And what can/should  the government and people do?

We also held a mini data exhibition, gathering all our and our partners' projects that deal with government data, to narrate the struggling process of establishing each project and why open data matters.

Before and after the event day, we also held clubhouse sessions, inviting other guests and those who are interested in this issue, but can't join the event day, to discuss about open data as well.

Due to Covid-19, the event was held with strict security measures, and a live broadcast was made for people who for health reasons could not attend personally. 

The event was developed with three short presentations, which served to initiate the debate and collaborative work with the participants who attended the event and those who followed the live broadcast. The proposed topics covered the tools and laws of transparency, participation and open data in Argentina, the comparative sample of open data from official national and local environment web pages and how to use them, and finally the invited organization ""Ecos D Mar"" made an exhibition of data on oil exploitation in the Argentine seas, its negative impact on the environment and the actions that the organization carried out to try to preserve the environment and marine fauna. 

After each talk, discussions were held between the attendees and the speakers, to try to reach conclusions and solutions to the problems raised. The attendees participated with great enthusiasm in each debate proposed at the event. 

Finally, we must emphasise that, as every year, the representation of gender was very important. Of the 3 speakers, 2 were women and the third a man. Likewise, the audience was mostly women.","This year's event left great lessons, both for our organisation and for the invited organizations and those who attended the event.

The event was organised in the valley with the aim of introducing the academic community to the availability and benefits of open data. The event was attended by more than 200 participants of various educational institutions across the country.

The full day event was well divided into two sessions. The first session started with the introductory speech where Mr. Ansaar Hussain Ghanayi (coordinator of the event) introduced the concept of open data. This was followed by a welcome note by principal of the college, Prof (Dr) Nasreen Aman. Prof M Y Peerzada, director Colleges, J&K Higher Education, who was the chief guest on the occasion, laid emphasis on the various dimensions of openness.

Prof S M Shafi (Former HOD, DLIS, University of Kashmir) gave a presentation on research data, its significance and management. Prof Shakil A Romshoo (Dean Research, University of Kashmir) talked about the importance of Earth Observation data and global databases in environmental studies.

In the second session, Dr Javiera Atenas (Associate Professor, University of Barcelona) emphasised over the need to promote and support the use of open data as an important open educational tool for better research and better environment. Prof Savithri Singh (country lead, Creative Commons India chapter) in her presentation talked about different licenses for open data content. Mr Nadim Akhtar Khan (Senior Assistant Professor, DLIS, University of Kashmir) focused over the practical implementations of open data and how different open data sets can be used in life.

Each presentation was followed by a discussion, where participants posed different questions as well as queries towards the resource persons. The event ended with a formal vote of thanks from Mr Ansaar Hussain Ghanayi.","The concept of open data was not that common among the research community, although our university (Cluster University Srinagar) promotes and stands for open access.

According to local reports, up to 100 metres of land has been invaded by Lake Tanganyika and thousands of houses were destroyed by the flooding. And due to the lack of risk information, this scenario could happen every year if no informative mechanism is set up locally.

This is why on the occasion of Open Data Day 2021, DRM Africa organised an event whose mission was to prevent vulnerable communities from river floods by providing risk information to exposed communities and the use of open data principles.

During the event, up to 10 participants including journalists and representatives from local counties were informed about risk areas and developed preventive measures for vulnerable communities.

Various activities dedicated to reducing the disaster risk through open data were carried including; • The flood risk analysis in the field and identification of infrastructures under floods risk • Creation and production of risk data • Communication of risk data through local radio stations

Various tools and techniques for data collection, analysis and communication have been used during the event including OpenStreetMap, Kobo Toolbox for remote data collection, etc.

After the project’s completion, infrastructures under risk were identified, counted and represented into datasets and spatial data in order to better inform exposed communities.

The event was animated by Kashindi Pierre, the CEO of DRM Africa.","During the event, we discovered various facts from vulnerable populations including:

• The lack of knowledge on the existence of the open data concept
• The lack of floods risk data that enable them better protect themselves

Green Map System became a ‘start open’ in 2018, when we opened all of our map making tools, green living icons and engagement practices. As a locally-led global sustainable communities network that has impacted 65 countries, we have lots of locally-led strategies and history to share. Most excitingly, for Open Data Day 2021, we introduced OGM2!

This panel focused on the new Open Green Map platform, OGM2, designed by open source developers, the GIS Collective, for Green Map communities charting local nature, culture and sustainable living resources. Still in beta, it’s adaptable for engaging a diversity of local voices and issues. Check out the list of features, as well as the video and deck from this event, our tutorials and demo days at [http://GreenMap.org/stories/ogm2](http://GreenMap.org/stories/ogm2)

Our event opened with background on the Green Map movement from director Wendy Brawer, followed by the GIS Collective’s Alexandra Casapu and Bogdan Szabo with the inside story on OGM2. There are already more than 30 Open Green Maps on the new platform, and Mary Hunt of FEEDJeffCo contributed her methodology for ensuring an effective process and powerful map for her community’s well being in Washington state. Discussion followed.

The OGM2 webapp is quite adaptable. Each map can have any size team behind it (4 levels of permissions; anyone can suggest sites, too), and you can make multiple maps and display the features (sites, lines or areas) which can have several icons, images and sounds on each description. It utilises Open Street Map, and unique base maps and icon sets are possible. You can import several kinds of data, export data (and allow others to) or embed these interactive maps. It’s free for non-commercial projects, too.","We invite you to watch the video and peruse the slides while considering what a Green Map can do for your community. Reach out to us any time - we’re glad to help you strategise - or simply register and get your map rolling on OGM2.

This involved a farmers organisation representative, GODAN Africa champions and Mukono District NGO forum board member. The virtual meet-up was done on Zoom to follow-up with the code of conduct for data and we had around 8 participants. 

We shared success stories and case studies on how open data is used in creating farmer’s map. This included using farmer’s profile data as a test case and the use of QGIS tool. This was done with reference to the article released by CTA as a guide; “Farmer profiling: Making Data Work for small holder farmers by CTA”.

We designed use cases based on what data the farmers map would have. This involved designing of data flows and streams (including on-farm data, off-farm data, aggregated data, imported data and exported data). 

We used design thinking to realise the layering and data flow of the Farmers Geo Map. This was done with a farmer in “Mukono District” who was doing banana plantation farming. 

We came up with action points which have sparked off the need to incorporate the data code of conduct into the shaping of the Farmers Geo Map. Post workshop engagements with GODAN data research expert will take place to understand the value of the code of conduct and how the farmers and small holder AgData structures will be strengthened. 

The event paved the way for a partnership with Youths in Technology and Development Uganda which is currently leading the piloting of Data4Ag code of conduct in Uganda. ","• Open data and its benefits should be realised in small holder farmer organisations, local government and central government.

• A code of conduct is a key in strengthening the transparency in opening and sharing of key data by the farmers and other data consumers.

• Open data workshops should be emphasised at district levels. This will help farmers organisations and agricultural workers to share the success stories and learn new practices in using of on-farm, off-farm, imported and exported data in understanding the performance of their farming practices and realisation of the agricultural value chain.

• Capacity development programmes on the use of key data for farmers should be designed to ensure continuity of the open data programmes and to strengthen the decision-making pillars for the farmers, farmers’ organisations, agribusinesses, policy makers, ministries and other key stakeholders.

• Open data courses should be incorporated into the curriculums for undergraduate students who take on courses involving data science, agriculture, environment, engineering, ICT to mention but a few.

The event was celebrated in two sessions; in my neighborhood with students of all age groups and with the secondary school students at Government Secondary School Kang Barombi. 

The event was celebrated under the theme “Raising awareness in students and uses of open data to solve community challenges”. The main objective of organising this event was to build capacity, create awareness on data use and illustrate to students how they could solve community issues using data.

The objectives of this event were:
• To raise awareness on what open data was all about, its availability and data issue in Cameroon.
• Building capacity of the students, sharing the benefits in the use of open data and how data can help drive innovation and solve community challenges. The work was structured on demonstration and presentation of mini-project belts of using open data, structured presentation, networking and collaboration. 

The following topics were explained in detail to the students:
• Social and economic aspects of open data in society. 
• Media and journalism data, Marketing and social media data, business directory data, academic data etc...
• Encouraging youth to explore open data and to digitally transform Cameroon.
• Using open data as a means to secure public and private funds.
• The use of open data to improve sustainability in agricultural production.

At the end, we were able to create reasonable awareness on the availability and benefits of open data. We encouraged students to explore open data so as to solve the challenges that plague the society. The students pleaded that an open data organisation should be created in Kumba Town to enhance learning.","I learned that in events like this, everyone around including kids should be considered because they are the future leaders of tomorrow. Teaching them about it will give them early access to data which will help drive innovation.

After facing numerous challenges such as electricity and power failure, I learn how to improvise and use local materials such as lamps, cardboard, bold makers, etc... to present my ideas in a more logical and illustrative manner.

I equally learned the benefits of open data in the following domain:

• **Transparency**. Open data supports public oversight of governments and helps reduce corruption by enabling greater transparency. 
• **Public Service Improvement**. Open data gives citizens the raw materials they need to engage their governments and contribute to the improvement of public services. 
• **Innovation and Economic Value**. Public data, and their re-use, are key resources for social innovation and economic growth. Open data provides new opportunities for governments to collaborate with citizens and evaluate public services by giving citizens access to data about those services. 
• **Efficiency**. Open data makes it easier and less costly for government ministries to discover and access their own data or data from other ministries, which reduces acquisition costs, redundancy and overhead.","I love open data because, through the adoption of open data policies in businesses, civil society and even governmental bodies, it increases efficiency, transparency, innovation and economic growth thereby solving the problems that plague our society.

In the framework of finding adaptive measures due to the rapid rise of the lake and strengthen the resilience of populations living in the risk areas. On the occasion of Open Data Day 2021, Mijas Multimedia organised an event whose overall goal was to use open data in strengthening the community resilience to the rapid rise of Lake Tanganyika. The project aimed at raising the awareness to the local community on the use of risk data in protecting exposed citizens. 

During the event, more hands-on than theoretical activities were carried out including;

• Spatial image comparison and analyzing: this process comprised of taking up to date spatial images in the field with drone
• Image analysis: this process consisted of comparing spatial images taken by drone in the field with out-of-date images from Google Maps (after analysis we realized that the Google Maps image of the city is from 2019) in the goal of understanding the advance level of the lake and project next social economic infrastructures
• Risk communication: this process consisted of sharing the data through various formats including spatial mapping and media outreach in the aim of informing those living under risk areas

After the event’s completion, the local authorities promised to take into account data produced during the event in reducing the disaster risk to exposed communities living at the coasts of Lake Tanganyika.","We’ve learned various lessons during and after the event’s completion including;

We had participant both online and onsite attend the event. a total of 32 people were onsite and 21 people online. 

Data were drawn from UNICEF, Nigeria Bureau of statistics and Water Aid were used as reference points for the discussion where it said 3 in 10 people in Nigeria don't have safe water close to home, 3 in 5 people in Nigeria don't have a toilet of their own.; 4 in 5 people in Nigeria lack handwashing facilities at home. 60 million Nigerians, or 33 per cent of the population, do not have access to safe water. We displayed out communities in Plateau state, Kaduna and the country's capital Abuja, where it can be seen that 10 in 10 people had no access to safe water, 5 in 5 not having access to handwashing facilities, with our research, we discovered that lack of access to WASH facilities is greatly caused by corruption, access to data, which leads to low participation of citizens in governance and its processes. To change this narrative, we built the capacity of participants on budget data sieving, how to effectively use the Freedom of Information Act as a tool for demanding information on the project and providing oversight on its implementations, leveraging social media as a tool for engaging government officials and amplifying corrupt cases in their communities.

Garba, a participant highlighted how he used the FOI and social media to engage and amplify corrupt practices as well as amplify the living conditions of people around his community, but it came with a price, he was invited by the government security agency for questioning, but he was able to get out of it easily as he posted on social media, and tagged relevant CSOs which came to his aid with legal council.

Another participant, Precious Adigwe was concerned about how citizens in rural communities are able to have the knowledge of data since it is complex and it is hard for them to understand and make actionable decisions. Wilson Atumeyi explained that in such cases, it is even unwise to use their local languages to make print works, as some of them can not read their local dialect, so it is advisable to make creative designs that when you have a glance at them, you will know what it means without reading a text, then get someone that understands their language to take them on the session for better understanding.

Finally, we agreed to create a knowledge-sharing platform where members can share data sieved for better engagement and a coalition that would ensure that this information is used to drive transparency and accountability in governance. ","Data is very important to driving accountability and transparency in governance. It is essential to always engage people even if you think they have knowledge of the concept, because most of our participants did not know the concepts of open data, open government or freedom of information.",It creates platform for dialogue and engagement on data and how citizens can leverage it for accountability.,,the-realities-of-wash-data,WAT,http://bit.ly/WaterWideODD2021,EMEA,"Europe, Middle East & Africa"

La transmisión se hizo a través de Facebook, YouTube y Periscope, y esto nos permitió llegar a 359 personas, una cifra mayor a la prevista. Cerramos con la rifa de diez ejemplares de la guía “Fiscalizar desde el periodismo. Una guía para monitorear obras y compras públicas”, editada por Ojoconmipisto.

Silvio Gramajo, especialista en temas de transparencia, explicó los conceptos sobre información pública. La rendición de cuentas, dijo, debe enfocarse en “los cuentos de la cuenta”. Es decir, en narrativas que expliquen las decisiones tomadas por cada municipalidad.

Isaias Morales, reportero de Ojoconmipisto y autor de la guía, se centró en los pasos a seguir para encontrar información en Guatecompras, el portal que registra todas las compras estatales, y en otros sitios de Datos Abiertos del ministerio de Finanzas. Son espacios que la ciudadanía puede utilizar para seguir la ruta del dinero público.

Daniel Ambeliz, analista de datos, compartió herramientas que utiliza para analizar las compras públicas, como Power BI. Hizo uso de una base de datos de compras de 2020 para identificar historias que podían ser contadas. Gladys Olmstead, community manager de Ojoconmipisto, compartió las notas informativas más destacadas que partieron de datos y de solicitudes de información pública para contar no sólo como se usan los fondos públicos sino también como el gobierno informa sobre la Covid–19.

Se sortearon diez ejemplares de la guía entre los 35 participantes que completaron el funcionario. Se les hará llegar por correo.","a. Existe una comunidad de estudiantes de periodismo que desea aprender sobre este tema. Quieren conocer por qué la Ley de Acceso a la Información Pública puede convertirse en una herramienta de trabajo periódistico, cuáles son los portales públicos y qué información podemos obtener de ellos. Pero también quieren aprender a navegar en ellos.

b. Este año se hizo la actividad de forma virtual por las restricciones existentes por la pandemia. Si bien permitió llegar a un número mayor de lo previsto (359 versus 25 personas) la interacción fue más limitada a cuando hacemos actividades cerradas. Pero nos permitió llegar a más lugares.

c. En 2022 esperamos realizar la actividad de manera presencial.",Nos da la oportunidad de compartir con estudiantes de periodismo qué hacemos y mostrarles que podemos contar historias a partir de los datos.,"Solicitamos a los participantes que quisieran participar en la rifa que se registraran, 56 lo hicieron.
