[![Build Status](http://travis-ci.org/okfn/opendataday.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/okfn/opendataday)

Open Data Day is a gathering of citizens in cities around the world to write applications, liberate data, create visualizations and publish analyses using open public data to show support for and encourage the adoption of open data policies by the world's local, regional and national governments.

You're invited. Again. The next Open Data Day will take place on Saturday, 4 March 2017.

Check <http://opendataday.org/> for public website.

## Editing / contributing

This site is built with [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/).  Install using pip or download it from their website.

It has a bunch of [dependencies](https://github.com/okfn/opendataday/blob/master/package.json), so do `npm install` and then `npm run build`.

`grunt` will watch for changes to your [SCSS files](https://github.com/okfn/opendataday/tree/master/assets/scss), and also [icons](https://github.com/okfn/opendataday/tree/master/assets/icons) (see [svgstore](https://github.com/FWeinb/grunt-svgstore)).

`lektor deploy` will deploy to the gh-pages branch, putting changes live, if you have deploy permissions.

### TODO

#### Translations

To translate the site we need to duplicate the [contents.lr](https://github.com/okfn/opendataday/blob/master/content/contents.lr) file, and save with the language code in the file name, like [contents+de.lr](https://github.com/okfn/opendataday/blob/master/content/contents%2Bde.lr).

We also need to add translations to [global-content.ini](https://github.com/okfn/opendataday/blob/master/databags/global-content.ini) and [main-nav.ini
](https://github.com/okfn/opendataday/blob/master/databags/main-nav.ini).

If we are adding new language to the site we also need to:

- Add the new language to [languages.json](https://github.com/okfn/opendataday/blob/master/databags/languages.json)
- Add the language to [project.lektorproject](https://github.com/okfn/opendataday/blob/master/project.lektorproject).

## Previous version

The previous version of the site has been moved to the [v1](https://github.com/okfn/opendataday/tree/v1) branch.
