intro_body:

**Open Data Day (ODD) is an annual celebration of open data all over the world**. Groups from likely every country create local events on the day where they will use open data in their communities. ODD is maintained and supported by the [Open Knowledge Foundation](https://okfn.org) (OKFN) through the [Open Knowledge Network](https://okfn.org/en/network/).

As a way to increase the representation of different cultures, since 2023 we offer the opportunity for organisations to host an Open Data Day event on the best date within a one-week period.  

**All outputs are open** for everyone to use and re-use.

intro_body_2:

**Thematic Focus: Open Data to Tackle the Polycrisis**  
  
We are still working with our communities to refine the theme for Open Data Day 2025.

Each year, the theme is deliberately broad to accommodate the most diverse practices and perspectives of working with open data for the public interest. In 2025, we want to address some of the most pressing issues of our time and go beyond climate justice. That's why we're developing the theme around the concept of [polycrisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycrisis), and more specifically the intersections between poverty and multiple inequalities, violence and conflict, and climate and disaster response.

Hey there open data enthusiast! You just saw that Open Data Day will be from 3-9 March 2025 and you're interested in hosting an event in your locality? Your only challenge now is finding the idea that will hit the right spot. Our friends from the open data community have some ideas and data sources worth checking out.

Visit the [CKAN website](https://ckan.org/about/instances/) to discover all the organisations around the world using CKAN to publish their data.

Use [data.world](https://data.world) to upload or find data from many sources and organise all aspects of a project - including data, notebooks, analysis and discussions - in a single workspace.

If you have data but don't know where to put it, you can use [DataHub](https://datahub.io). You can publish datasets, [search for relevant data](https://datahub.io/search), [browse thematic data collections](https://datahub.io/collections) and [request help](https://gitter.im/datahubio/chat) with your open data publishing.
