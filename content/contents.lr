Use [data.world](https://data.world) to upload or find data from many sources and organize all aspects of a project - including data, notebooks, analysis, and discussions - in a single workspace.

You can access the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/) to find data related to humanitarian actions from different sources.

If you have data but don't know where to put it, you can use the [CKAN DataHub](https://datahub.ckan.io/). You can publish or register datasets, create and manage groups and communities.

resources_ideas_theme_3: Tracking Public Money flows
---
resources_ideas_theme_3_text:

If you are planning on organizing a track to follow the money, here are some interesting ideas and projects you can
use to run your event:

[#DataOnTheStreets International Rally](http://www.fiscaltransparency.net/blog_open_public.php?IdToOpen=6323). A great opportunity to invite the public to use the data generated by governments, go out to the streets and see how data reflects in their real life. It is a public participation process in the budget implementation phase through open data and digital tools, such as maps and visualizations.

[Better Budget Dataquest for sustainable development](http://www.fiscaltransparency.net/blog_open_public.php?IdToOpen=6309). the Dataquest is an opportunity to find new insights on certain topics and innovative ideas to improve budget allocations and execution.

These are two ways to engage people using budget and spending data.

LGBTQ rights - http://www.lgbtdata.com/ (note: This website does not state that the data is open, but links to datasets)
War crimes  - see for example how BVT datalab showed the story of the bombing in Barcelona during the civil war
Immigration - see current work of the migrant files, openmigration + data from UNHCR on refugee situations
Internet shutdowns - ways to combine information from AccessNow, Dyn Research, Akamai  (SOTI) with other data sources
Tax - could share some interesting things from Open Data for Tax Justice project about overlap between tax and human rights
Tracking poverty in cities - not using open data, but interesting example of how alternative stories about poverty are told.
The City of Indianapolis developed an open data portal to show information about the use of force, officers ­involved shootings and complaints against officers.)
