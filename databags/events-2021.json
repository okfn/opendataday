The [YouthMappers network](https://www.youthmappers.org/) and the [PoliMappers group](https://polimappers.github.io/) were also introduced.\n\nIn the second part of the event, we had the honour of hosting Dimitris Karakostis, Technical Manager and Senior Geospatial Officer at [World Food Programme](https://www.wfp.org/), who explained to the participants how WFP uses OpenStreetMap data to update its mapping resources and thus provide optimal support to people working in the field.\n\nFinally, in the third part of the event, we provided a short tutorial to learn how to map the simplest features, namely buildings, with iDeditor. Participants then collaborated on mapping project 1148 on [TeachOSM \"Mapping Tartus\"](https://tasks.teachosm.org/projects/1148), created to enrich the geographical information of that area of Syria, where WFP is operating.",
      "report_question_2": "Thanks to the event, as organisers we were able to see that the interest in collaborative and open mapping is shared by people with very different academic/professional/personal backgrounds from all over the world. In particular, considerable curiosity emerged in relation to the tools and technologies that can be used by anyone to contribute to mapping for humanitarian purposes.\n\nAs for the participants, they acquired basic mapping skills that will be enriched during our [upcoming events](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PoliMappers/Collaborative_and_Humanitarian_Mapping_2021) and, in general, the usefulness of the contributions, as they are closely related to the work of WFP, has been enhanced.\n\nFinally, the practical part of the event produced [excellent results](https://resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-changesets?comment=opendataday%20polimappers#10/34.9456/36.0942) in terms of quantity (more than 50 OSM users mapped over 5000 buildings) and quality (the contributions were validated by the PoliMappers team and in general a good level of mapping was found).",

      "report_question_1": "We launched a call for participation among individuals, activists, researchers, collectives, NGOs to share their knowledge on co-housing and communities of sharing in Lisbon and beyond. More specifically, this workshop aimed at starting a debate about how municipal estates could play a role in rethinking housing, commons and care, going beyond the models of property we usually work with. \n\nWe asked the participants (16 persons) to share experiences, knowledge, information, ideas about the following topics: concepts of community and sharing, social architecture, inspirations/models, local initiatives, available data and mapping and legal framework. Engaging in a horizontal discussion and using a collaborative whiteboard provided the structure for mapping experiences, data sources and ideas. The participants decided to follow with monthly meetings. \n\nThe group - approximately 25 people including those who expressed interest but couldn't participate this time - will be invited to continue forming a working group to learn, explore and build an advocacy strategy. \n\nThere are different lines of action we would like to follow:\n\n\u2022 Exploring visions about urban space based on the concepts of commons and care to develop concrete projects and imagine a more comprehensive change, including legislative one.\n\u2022\u00a0Learning from other initiatives and study their advocacy strategies, as well as sharing the learnt lessons to spread and replicate projects. \n\u2022\u00a0Creating alliances with other housing rights movements to join forces and discuss conflicting interests and intersecting processes. \n\u2022 Mapping and visualising data about municipal and state-owned real estate - based both on the public inventory of vacant properties and grassroots mapping initiatives. \n\u2022 Looking at data on housing inequalities. Using data visualisation as a tool of advocacy.",
      "report_question_2": "The event provided an occasion for mapping relevant actors and knowledge and established a starting point for a process that holds the potential to create alliances and set up a joint advocacy strategy. The workshop highlighted the importance of creating, reinforcing and connecting grassroots initiatives and movements that promote alternative perspectives on housing by creating spaces of collective learning.",
      "report_question_3": "We believe in and work towards the vision of knowledge as commons. Indeed, the collective TuTela Learning Network bases its initiatives on the idea of radical sharing and the importance of connecting and sharing activist knowledge. We see Open Data Day as an opportunity to raise awareness among activists on the opportunities that engaging with open data holds for movements. Our workshop joined people from different perspectives and backgrounds in a horizontal discussion and sharing between participants. Open Data Day provided an opportunity for connecting people and starting a joint work.",

      "report_question_1": "Our Open Data Day was unfortunately an online event due to the situation in the country. Still we managed to attract many people. Attendance was mixed from members of the public to corporate actors and government.\n\nThe point of the event was to introduce solutions based on mapping open data that exist but should be communicated more amongst the public and also put in practice. These are the solutions that can make an everyday life of each and every one of us easier. For instance, the Council of Ljubljana has created numerous apps to make\u00a0living in Ljubljana easier. One of these is for instance \u201c[Trenutek v Ljubljani](https://www.ljubljana.si/sl/trenutek-v-ljubljani/)\u201d (A moment in Ljubljana) where Ljubljana citizens can see all traffic relevant information, availability of parking spaces, bikes, walking routes and also the quality of air and water at your location. Slovenia and Ljubljana are in the earthquake zone. The Council of Ljubljana has also [created an app](http://potrog2.vokas.si/) where each citizen can evaluate earthquake consequences on its residency. This app is unfortunately very unknown to the public and should be properly disseminated.\u00a0\n\nSlovenia is in economic crises. The unemployment rate is rising. Slovenian entrepreneur Miha P\u0161enica from [Mihov.com](https://www.mihov.com/) has come to an idea to use open mapping data of Slovenian enterprises and information of jobs available at Institute of Employment. The company has linked the two and created a database free to use for the citizens of Slovenia. But a problem arose\u00a0when the Institute of Employment changed its method of publicised data. It could no longer be transferred and linked. So, the question of consistency was posed to Opsi hub, the organization responsible for open data in Slovenia.",
      "report_question_2": "Open data is important. Open data should be used and should be available on many levels. At the end of the day, we concluded that we spend thousands of Euros for creating apps for the better goods of the citizens, but we forget that the real value comes from the use itself. Therefore, the solution needs to be communicated properly and loudly enough to reach the end user. Only in this way can the solution get the right value and usability. \n\nWe have also learned that open data should be in the format that can be reused for better good. And last but not least we learned that the key to open data is digital trust, the free flow of non-personal data and that personal data should be properly secured.",

      "report_question_1": "Our event this year had a peculiarity, which was that the data we wanted to use wasn\u2019t actually open. To give a little background: we are the civil society counterparts of the Social Inclusion commitment included in [Costa Rica\u2019s Open State Action Plan](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Costa-Rica_Action-Plan_2019-2022_Revised_EN.pdf), which aims to support the [Territorial Councils of Rural Development](https://www.inder.go.cr/territorios/index.aspx), the main participatory bodies for fostering rural development in the country, so that they can be more transparent, open and inclusive. But on the course of this work we found a very important stumbling block: the data about the projects these Councils are implementing was not accessible anywhere.\n\nLeveraging the fact that Open Data Day was approaching, we asked the [Institute for Rural Development (Inder)](https://www.inder.go.cr/) - the public institution that assists and partly finances the Councils - if they had this data because we were interested in holding an event to disseminate the important work being done by the Councils. They were kind to share the data with us, but the file they gave us was not exactly ready for public consumption, so we had to do quite a bit of work to clean the data and present it in a way that was more clear and attractive to people.\n\nFor our event, we designed a Data Expedition where the participants were able to access and explore for the first time ever the data of the projects being implemented by the Councils, their location, the money spent on them, their percentage of completion, the organisations involved and many other key info that was previously undisclosed. It should be mentioned that none of this data was confidential, it just hadn\u2019t been made available. But the great thing about Open Data Day is that it gave us the impetus to change that situation and demonstrate how data can be used to improve and monitor rural development.",
      "report_question_2": "Our Open Data Day celebration, which usually takes place in a physical space, had to forcibly be relocated to a virtual environment this year because of the pandemic. This brought with it a series of challenges regarding how to translate the experience of a Data Expedition to an online setting in which we cannot interact face-to-face with the participants.\n\nOne of the main challenges had to do with time: people do not have the same endurance sitting in front of their computer on a videoconference than they do in an in-person activity. So we had to reduce the scope of the event, which meant that time was too short to fully explore and follow through on any hypothesis or relationships that may be identified, but it at least planted the seeds for further data exploration.\u00a0\n\nWe also found out that many of the people in the event were there as observers: very interested to learn about the data being made available, but not with the conditions or inclinations to actively participate. Therefore, we successfully repurposed the event to this situation, focusing more on presenting the reports and visualisations that we prepared, explaining the possibilities for further use of the data, and answering any questions or comments that participants wanted to share with us.",
      "report_question_3": "We love Open Data Day because, as an organisation that aims to transform the relationship between governments and citizens, it is an excellent opportunity to prompt public institutions to open their data and share it with the people, so that through the different activities that are planned throughout the day both governments and citizens can understand the potential of open data and collaborate to reach better solutions to our common problems.",
      "report_question_4": "One of the most important outcomes of this event was the opening and publication of data that was previously closed and unpublished. Not only that, but the work we did in cleaning the data and visualising it using maps will go a long way in allowing the Councils and anyone else to harness its potential for rural development. \n\nFor now the data is only available in our [Tableau Public account](https://public.tableau.com/profile/accesa#!/), but in the coming months we\u2019ll work with Inder and the Councils to ensure that this data can be more widely-disseminated and used in ways that can foster the transparency, inclusiveness and decision-making process of the Councils.",

      "report_question_1": "Our event celebrated open data by conducting a free physical data journalism training to 10 journalism and mass communication students from different universities in Dar es Salaam to maximise the use of open data and increase accountability through data journalism. \n\nThe eight-hour training trained the students the basics in data journalism by explaining in detail the concept of open data, how to scrap and clean data to create open data, laws regulating data journalism in Tanzania, data analysis, data visualisation and how to develop data-driven stories from open data for radio, TV, newspapers and online platforms. \n\nThe training was a unique opportunity to the students since they got a chance to learn and practise new skills that can make them competitive in the current job market after finishing their studies.\n\nConducting such training with students was a stepping stone to creating better journalists who can add value in their reporting and producing content that can impact lives in future.\n",
      "report_question_2": "One of the foremost lessons learnt from the students is that data journalism is not taught completely in colleges or universities offering journalism or mass communication courses in Tanzania. Nearly all the lessons were new to the students and they acknowledged that the opportunity gave them exposure and the skills were key in building their careers after school.\n\nAt Nukta Africa we learnt that there are useful open data dashboards by the government and other stakeholders which are not commonly used and known to most people. Also, former famous open data dashboards like opendata.go.tz are no longer available to the public. Therefore, conducting these training makes people aware and informed on data that could help them in business, reporting and decision making.\n\nFurthermore, emphasis on maximising the use of open data in the community through data journalism is one the best way to utilise the resources available. Open data dashboards may not yield expected results if journalists cannot use the data to find stories relevant to their community. Data-driven stories with contexts from ground reporting has proved to be more effective in increasing transparency and by accounting people in power. ",

Nikesh Balami, CEO/co-founder of Open Knowledge Nepal, started the event by welcoming all the individuals and oriented on the tentative goal of the gathering. He highlighted the core values of coming together as a community and contributing to the common goal. The gathering was more of an informal collaborative forum, and it was rightly highlighted by Arogya Koirala from Kathmandu Living Labs. He opined the need for developing a peer learning and collaborative open community rather than a top-down approach of coaching the participants. It was interesting to note, how all participants passively agreed to the notion of more informal, open peer-based learning in community settings.\n\nAfter the introduction session, the event free flowed. Everyone worked on what best fits the goal of the event, as per their expertise and through collaboration. Some of the works included:\n- Solving bugs in the \u2018Open Data Nepal\u2019 portal.\n- Developing a data scraper for scraping the data such that it would be convenient to convert it in open format.\n- Brainstorming for the designing logo of Air Quality Nepal bot (currently available on Twitter).\n- Refining data from the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board.\n- Researching on government portals and other relevant organizations, discovering useful climate and environment data, making it open and uploading it in the Open Data Nepal\u2019s portal.\n\nHere is the event blog post: [http://oknp.org/2021/03/14/rebuilding-community-to-work-on-climate-and-environment-data/](http://oknp.org/2021/03/14/rebuilding-community-to-work-on-climate-and-environment-data/)",

We had 58 people participating in the event, including civil society representatives, university students, and the CoST Honduras technical team. At the beginning of the event, CoST's LATAM Regional Manager welcomed the attendees and made a brief introduction about Open Data Day and why it is important for CoST.\n\nWe then had the participation of CoST's Head of Members and Affiliates, who presented the advances in the use of open data that CoST programs are achieving worldwide. One of the examples she presented was the Transparent Infrastructure Open Data Portal, a tool designed and developed by the CoST Ukraine program to analyze more than 7000 public infrastructure contracts. The analytical report is available at [https://portal.costukraine.org/graph.html](https://portal.costukraine.org/graph.html). The third participation was from one of CoST Honduras' project managers who presented the programme's effort to design and develop a data analysis tool named InfraS. This tool aims to measure indicators built from public infrastructure data, identify red flags and issues, and present recommendations to the correspondent authorities on how they can fix those issues to achieve sustainable infrastructure.\n\nThe next part of the event was a more interactive session where the participants, divided into four groups, were able to talk to CoST's experts and answer some questions aimed at identifying potentially user data needs for the InfraS tool.",
      "report_question_2": "We learned that the feedback from active citizens could benefit the ways the government discloses information, especially when, in most cases, data from local governments is not easy to access.

We engaged 15 civil society organisations including the Executive Director of Widows Lifeline, the wife of the first president of Nigeria (Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe) Prof. Uche Azikiwe and five members of our own organisation in the event.\u00a0\n\nThough this law which is rooted in other international laws, you find that implementation remains a problem. The event was marked by a presentation from the ED of Equity Watch Initiative, Dr. Chiemezie Atama, which was followed by an interactive session, then questions and answers. The presentation focused on what FOIA is all about, states where it has been domesticated, FOIA as an advocacy tool, how it relates to the issues of accountability and transparency, gender budgeting and implementation, monitoring and follow up mechanisms as well as the the role of CSOs. It was a clarion call for all CSOs in Nsukka to follow up and monitor gender budgeting and implementation to ensure accountability and good governance.",

Clear explanations of what FOIA is all about.\n2. How we can leverage FOIA to ensure transparency and accountability in governance.\n3. The fact that only few states have domesticated FOIA in Nigeria despite its potential for transformational governance.\n4. The role of CSOs in ensuring transparency and good governance.\n5. Engagement process to ensure good governance.\n6. The need to continue to advocate for open data.\n7. Gender budgeting and the need for follow up to ensure proper implementation.",

[GeOsm](http://geosm.org/) is an open source geospatial data portal, 100% African, scalable on all administrative units and based on - but not only on - the OpenStreetMap free database. \n\nWe celebrated the day by gathering several actors of the digital ecosystem, namely a representative of the OSM Foundation, students, professionals from the ministries of urban planning and housing and local development, researchers and the GeOsm team. There were a total of 20 participants.\n\nThe event took place on March 12 2021 in the premises of GeOsm, beginning at 11am and ending at 2pm. The exchanges were focused on the development of an open source solution from open data.\n\n[GeOsm](http://geosm.org/) is the solution presented which today is deployed in 21 countries and at the communal level in eight cities of North Cameroon and six of south-west Cameroon under the title [Geocommunal](http://limbe.geosm.org/map).\n\nWe presented:\n- The reasons why we decided to use free data and to make our platform an open source namely the fact of being able to allow each contributor to use and modify its core and in return make valuable improvements.\n- We also discussed its various functionalities and the potential instances to be set up to meet the needs listed by local collectivities to improve the management of their resources, such as geofiscal for fiscality and geotourism for tourism.\n\nIt was also the occasion to cement the partnership between the OSM Foundation and GeOsm through the signing of a trademark license agreement.\n\nA brainstorming session was also held among the participants, who were able to give their perception of the use of data.

      "report_question_1": "iWatch Africa, marked the 2021 Open Data Day last Saturday with virtual event with focused on leveraging data to promote women safety within the digital ecosystem in Africa.\n\nThe theme for the event was, \u2018Leveraging data on abuse of female journalists in Ghana to promote equal development within the digital ecosystem in Africa,\u2019 and was joined by over 40 participants across the continent.\n\nCo-founder of iWatch Africa, Moro Seidu delivered a presentation with focus on the current data on abuse of women journalists in Ghana. Moro stressed that \u201calthough the introduction of social media has enhanced communication and participation on social media platforms, it has not been friendly on the female gender.\u201d\n\nMoro cited iWatch Africa 2020 data which showed that while the number of male journalists monitored were three times more than their female counterparts, 46 per cent of the total number of online abuses recorded by iWatch Africa were directed at women journalists in Ghana.\n\nSecond speaker, Nashilongo Gervaslus blamed the patriarchal upbringing in many homes across the continent for the sort of accountability which treats women with a different sort of lens and opens them up to abuse. She recommended that governments across the continent introduce cyber-crime legislation to protect women online.\n\nOur final speaker Sheilah Birgen, also stressed the need for newsrooms to provide support for female journalists and protect them against online misogyinistic mobs. Sheilah also argued that, \u201cthe stigma relating to these abuses deters some women from speaking about it.\u201d\n\nThe event ended with a resolution led by Gideon Sarpong, to work on mainstreaming digital rights units in 50 newsrooms in West Africa to mitigate the risks that online harassment of women journalists poses to the press freedom and equal development within the digital ecosystem in Africa.",

The webinar featured youthful speakers who actively rely on open data sources for their typical work. The panelist was drawn from both the public and private sector institutions including; The Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis, Standard Group PLC, Dalberg Consulting Group, and the National Youth Council. \n\nThe theme of the discussion included progress made in enhancing data availability and access for use in sustainable policy development; opportunities for open data in advancing the national and international development agenda; experience of non-state actors in leveraging existing data sources; challenges in utilizing existing data and research in youth advocacy; and possible mitigation measures to enhance uptake of data and research. The webinar created awareness of the opportunities to use open data for local content development in Kenya. \n\nThe webinar featured practical open data mining sessions that sensitised the participants of the different national and international websites that host open data day. This was demonstrated through a PowerPoint presentation and live data mining on KNBS and the World Bank open data sites.  \n\nAs part of our campaign to commemorate Open Data Day we also published an article in today\u2019s issue of Standard Media Group LLC on Data as an Asset for Water Management \n\nThe Webinar ended with call for action on four thematic areas which include: \n- Open data to respond to #changing dynamics of data needs\n- Incentivise private sector models for data collection \n- Data disaggregation to fit smaller unit decision making \n- Promote data journalism in Kenya",
      "report_question_2": "Currently, there\u2019s limited conversation between the producers of the data, and those in demand of the data \u2013 private and development sector, thus the open data collection is not always informed by market needs. Going forward, the consumer (general public, private sector, and development sector) data needs ought to inform decisions on what open data is collected. \n\nThere is need to incentivise the private sector to stimulate private sector models for data collection to ensure that the open data is timely and substantive. Leveraging the private sector would enable the adoption of innovations in data management such as data science and data engineering. Moreover, it\u2019s essential to have the open data packaged in easily consumable formats by the diverse stakeholders. \n\nGiven that journalists convey open data and its social-economic implications to the general public, data journalism becomes an integral component in the capacity building of journalists. Thus the need for data journalism to sensitize the journalist on local open data sources. This could be done through government and private sector partnerships. Additionally, non-profit organisations such as 254 Youth Policy Caf\u00e9 could take a role in sensitising local journalists on data sources in Kenya.",

We chose this project as it has been one of the biggest projects initiated by the current government to overcome climate change but at the same time had been under scrutiny due to corruption allegations. \n\nThe event started with the team evaluating the available data in the monitoring report published by WWF (third party). After understanding the datasets and their correlations, the team came up with a plan to share a consolidated dataset containing the location data of nurseries and the total number of tree saplings sown in the area. With this subset of data, the team was only able to map around 12.6% of the total trees planted (1 billion) as the rest of the information (number of plantation) was not published in the report. The motivation behind working on this subset of data was to publish something meaningful for the developers as well as plotting the available data on a map to make it understandable for the public. \n\nThe team was divided into three parts. The first team was responsible for segregating and cleaning the datasets, the second team combined the data from different tables, processed it, and converted it into a machine-readable format and the third team worked on a public-facing dashboard where these coordinates were to be mapped.\n\nAt the end of the event, the team was able to publish the dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/aliirz/billion-tree-tsunami) as well as the map of all the coordinates through ArcGIS (https://arcg.is/1jmbjm). This proof of concept will now be shared with relevant government agencies working on the climate and environment to open further datasets that can make this initiative more transparent and accountable.",

The event\u2019s goal was to encourage the re-use of payment data for the early detection of potential conflicts of interest and raise the participants\u2019 data visualisations skills.\n\nFirst event: [https://www.facebook.com/events/472106700473912](https://www.facebook.com/events/472106700473912)\nSecond event: [https://okee.ee/andmeklubi/rahakasutuse-visualiseerimise-tootuba/](https://okee.ee/andmeklubi/rahakasutuse-visualiseerimise-tootuba/)\nOpener application: [https://opener.ee](https://opener.ee)\u00a0\nPayment data from the public sector: [https://saldo.rtk.ee/saldo-app/](https://saldo.rtk.ee/saldo-app/)",
      "report_question_2": "The main lessons of the events were that data journalism is still in its infancy in Estonia. More effort needs to be invested in the capacity building of journalists in that matter. There are also many challenges for more accessible investigations, sometimes due to the intentional use of legislation for restricting access to certain information and data (even if the legitimate reasons for it are debatable). Furthermore, there is relatively low awareness about where particular information and data could be found, and how accessible these are. \n\nWith that in mind, our event hopefully contributed to raising awareness on the subject, and we\u2019ll keep working on it in the future. In the second event, we learned that, although publically available payment data is not yet available in a machine-readable format, the relevant stakeholders are putting significant effort into making that available later this spring. People who are issuing payment data to the government are eager to see what applications will be built based on it, while they still seem sceptical about its impact. Concrete use cases need to be built, which would in turn, show them the impact of open data more clearly.",

Items collected included; plastic bottles, plastic bags, tie-tie, sandals, shoes, clothes, tyres, mosquito nets and glass bottles. \n\nThe event then was followed by a short dialogue on the importance of volunteerism in generating quality data. This dialogue was facilitated by Ms Asma Ahmada Hamad (ZAVECO) and Mrs Raya Idrissa Ahmada (SUZA)\n\nAt last students got the opportunity to observe biodiversity associated with mangrove forests. Mr Iddi Hassan Ali (ZAVECO) guided students through the mangrove ecosystem to let them explore the real world, linking theories and practices. We would like to express our gratitude to the Open Knowledge Foundation for their support.",

Local NGOs run by local communities often lack access to funding for this kind of work but can partner with students in collecting quality, timely and relevant data to help make informed decisions about their projects. In this manner, students can gain useful work experience before entering formal employment and it could be a chance to innovate to solve more societal problems.",

Still the hackathon is not closed, registration is open, and mentors are ready to provide assistance till 22nd of March.\n2. The topic \"innovate the \"death sector\"\" is not enough fancy for young people. However, it attracted the senior lawyer of Lithuanian Post (the first time in hackathon). \n3. There is not enough open data sources for innovations of cemetery care, data is not structured, not available. However, we have presented the idea based on DBPedia, how to create datasets by using crowdsourcing technologies.\n4. We attracted four speakers to the opening ceremony of the hackathon: \na) Eimantas Nork\u016bnas - he is open data enthusiast, have developed 3 successful open data based projects and even one project influenced a ban of commercial fishery. Eimantas have shared his experience and explained what data is going to be opened by Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Lithuania. \nb) Ernesta Seili\u016bt\u0117 - she is legal design professional, explained how legal design could help to solve problems, especially by innovating \"death sector\". She presented valuable examples, and highlighted points, what to take in mind, when we create applications/services for users.\nc) Dr Marius Laurinaitis  - presented how GDPR is used to block open data initiatives, discussed legal aspects of working/collecting of data. Presented that it is save to collect data of dead people, but we need not to forget the principle of Honour to the Dead.\nd) Dr Martynas Mockus - presented how crowdsource technologies could be used to create open data sets, also presented problems in \"death sector\".",

Organised to mark Open Data Day, the event had the goal of raising awareness to the Congolese community - especially the women\u2019s rights community - on the use of open data in defending the women\u2019s accessibility to employment.\n\nThe event\u2019s activities consisted of paying attention to the open data contribution in increasing the women\u2019s accessibility to employment and helping foster balance between men and women in the professional world.\n\nDuring the event\u2019s activities, both the women and men attending the event\u2019s activities analysed factors that hinders women\u2019s accessibility to employment locally.\n\nAs most job offers are now published over the internet, participants deplored the lack of necessary knowledge of women about how to find jobs through the internet. Furthermore, the weak internet penetration in hard-to-reach areas exacerbates this situation as most of women didn\u2019t know about the existence of platforms for job offers.\n\nIn response to this challenge, the event\u2019s facilitator shared two local platforms for job offers - Julisha.cd and MediaCongo.net - and job offer data was exploited in teaching them how to find a local job offer.\n\nAfter the project\u2019s completion, participants were able to;\n\u2022 Search employment data from local platforms and share them to women\u2019s networks in order to reach out to them who need them\n\u2022 Subscribe to the job platform to get timely job alerts\nAt the end of the activities, participants promised to advocate for the simplification of the conditions in treating and analysing the job documents submitted by the women.",

This session was followed by a short presentation about Open Data Day, [Youthmappers](https://www.youthmappers.org/) and the EverywhereSheMaps initiative by Mrs Raya Ahmada, SUZA Youthmappers mentor and regional ambassador.\n\nThe first speaker, Jamila Mdungi, a Resilience Academy Intern and SUZA Youthmappers alumni, started with an Introduction to GIS.\n\nThe next speaker, Asya Juma, talked about the [Geonode](https://geonode.resilienceacademy.ac.tz/), a climate risk database.\u00a0Asya is also an RA intern and SUZA Youthmappers committee member. She introduced the importance of supporting research, education and disaster-risk management practices.\n\nThe sessions were followed by data visualisations presented by three SUZA Youthmappers members and alumni, all of which are females.

      "report_question_1": "For the first time we celebrated the Open Data Day in Feira de Santana. The date marked the beginning of a discussion with various sectors of the city and beyond about transparency in the city, its problems and opportunities.\n\nFeira is a city that, unfortunately, is marked by a lack of government transparency. There is a lack of knowledge both by the citizens about their rights to have access to any public data and by the public authorities about the benefits of opening their data and letting society participate in solving problems.\n\nThinking about the local reality, we organised two round tables: the first one about transparency as public policy and the second one about open science. In the first, we discussed the role of transparency in the creation of public policies and its impact on popular participation. We were attended by members of the press, public agencies and activists. A councilman also participated in the panel. In the second we talked about open science, a theme that has become even more relevant during the pandemic of the new coronavirus. We had the presence of researchers from the region and from renowned institutions such as FIOCRUZ.\n\nBesides the round tables, we also organised a hackathon to analyze the city's data, aiming to encourage the exploration of data that the open data project of Feira has been collecting.\n\nThe event was 100% online and can be followed on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx0zm7IFCou6_L43PoZBOq1e4lgK3ccH9). Photos and videos can be seen [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/mskUV3MVZsGc4PAEA).\n\nThe organisation was done by Dados Abertos de Feira, a civil society initiative that advocates for transparency in Feira de Santana, and the Graduate Program in Computer Science from the State University of Feira de Santana.",
      "report_question_2": "The most relevant thing we learned was that collaboration is essential to advance any agenda. By bringing together a civil society activist group and researchers, we can address the same theme within the needs of each group.\n\nWe also learned about the needs that exist regarding data. We had almost 30 teams signed up for the hackathon, but only one delivered. When we approached the teams to understand the reasons for dropping out, we realized that two reasons were essential: 1) the deadline was short (two days) and 2) a lot of data that the participants wanted to explore is not available.\n\nUnderstanding more about the data and the limitations in data exploration will help us guide the actions of the Feira Open Data initiative and what collaborations can be made in the future to make data more accessible in the city of Feira de Santana.",

Oil spill soon follows from the consequences of their activities, destroying the ecosystem and micro inhabitants that the host communities rely on for livelihoods and socio-economic vitality. This year at our Open Data Day event we teach the students of Ignatius Ajuru University in Rivers State Nigeria and our mangroves ambassadors on how to use the Forest Watcher app and the Global Forest Watch web tools to collect data and monitor mangrove loss and gain in on project sites ",

He lamented the poor availability of adequate and reliable data for decision-making and policy formulation on environmental problems facing the region.\u00a0\n\nThe third presentation was made by Mr Sammy Joel who vividly introduced the audience to the open data technologies used to track forest loss/gain and how it can be deployed to solve environmental hitches particularly those relating to that of mangrove deforestation in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.\u00a0\n\nThe tools mentioned were the FOREST WATCHER MOBILE APP and FOREST WATCHER WEB from the open data portal of the GLOBAL FOREST WATCH. The technologies are an online flat-form that provides data sets and tools for monitoring forest in real-time. Mr Sammy also did some forest data visualisation to participants using datasets from the Global Forest Watch open data portal.

      "report_question_1": "To share information on how people can track public money, Open Data Day Porto Alegre 2021, held online on March 13th, brought together significant initiatives led by civil society, journalists, researchers, and programmers. Representants of the open data community who were invited to conduct talks and workshops have revealed their knowledge through speaking and demonstrating tools and interacting with the audience. \n\nThere were activities all day, and the live sessions were transmitted on YouTube. Over 70 people participated in the morning and around 40 people in each workshop in the afternoon. The recording of the three sessions is already available and reached, together, around 450 views in the same weekend that #ODDPOA2021 occurred. \n\nIn the morning, Georg Neumann (Open Contracting Partnership) presented information on what citizens should pay attention to when monitoring public contracts, especially in Covid-19 times, once emergencies have the potential to increase corruption risk. \n\nAfter his talk, five panelists presented their projects on the discussion \u201cInvestigating public spending through open data and the Access to Information Law.\u201d. Maria Vit\u00f3ria Ramos (Fiquem Sabendo) explained how to use the Access of Information Law to uncover military pensions data. \u00c1lvaro Justen and Reinaldo Chaves (Cruza Grafos) demonstrated how to combine information about politicians and business partner companies to investigate corruption. Jonas Coelho (Transpar\u00eancia Brasil) showed a specialized project to monitor the public contracting of food to be distributed in schools. Fernando Barbalho (Secretaria do Tesouro Nacional) presented several public databases to consult the national and local government budget to Covid-19 expenses. The session was coordinated by Luciana Kraemer (Unisinos). \n\nIn the afternoon, the event offered two workshops. Juliana Rodrigues (Unisinos) explained the public budget\u2019s main elements, while Felipe Soares (UFRGS) demonstrated how to use network analysis to comprehend disinformation involving politicians and other public agents. Both sessions were coordinated by Mar\u00edlia Gehrke (Afonte Jornalismo de Dados). \n\nOpen Data Day Porto Alegre was organized by Mar\u00edlia Gehrke and Ta\u00eds Seibt (Afonte Jornalismo de Dados). It was supported by Open Knowledge Foundation, Open Contracting Partnership, and Unisinos. \n\nOpening panel: [https://youtu.be/CEc30sIcYys](https://youtu.be/CEc30sIcYys)\n\nWorkshop about the public budget: [https://youtu.be/oYpqehDUBwU](https://youtu.be/oYpqehDUBwU)\n\nWorkshop and demonstration of network analysis: [https://youtu.be/cJxW2OzoOSc](https://youtu.be/cJxW2OzoOSc)\n",
      "report_question_2": "Collaboration is required to create significant initiatives inside the open data community. People rarely have all the abilities to run a project only by themselves. It was evident in our opening panel: the five participants have known each other from before, mainly due to previous work. All of them have different backgrounds. The panelists also discussed the importance of offering an open-sourced and well-documented code to allow the public to scrutinize and reuse it in other projects. \n\nBesides, the participants have highlighted the importance of demonstrating tools that help in public monitoring. Brazil has one of the highest number of deaths due to Covid-19, and it is paramount to comprehend public databases and contracts to monitor public attitudes to cope with the pandemic. For instance, the panelists have presented information on checking the amount of money spent by the national government in cities and states. \n\nFurthermore, it was challenging to organize an online event this year and still guarantee an engaging schedule. Simultaneously, we were able to invite panelists from different parts of the country, and the audience was not geographically limited. In this regard, it was an opportunity to expand open data beyond Porto Alegre. \n",
      "report_question_3": "What I love the most about Open Data Day is the opportunity to meet people with different backgrounds and discuss relevant topics with a collaborative community. In general, people who celebrate Open Data Day do not just expect transparency from the government but also make significant changes in society.

A carga hor\u00e1ria total foi 6 horas, dividas em dois per\u00edodos (manh\u00e3 e tarde). A Profa Dra Silvia Elena Ventorini (UFSJ) apresentou a import\u00e2ncia da data em prol da divulga\u00e7\u00e3o e uso dos dados abertos. A palestrante Profa Dra \u00c9velyn M\u00e1rcia Possa (Instituto de Desenvolvimento Sustent\u00e1vel Mamirau\u00e1), ressaltou a import\u00e2ncia de dados abertos para Observa\u00e7\u00e3o da Terra tendo como exemplos dois casos em que os dados livres foram utilizados como parte da solu\u00e7\u00e3o de pontos de tens\u00e3o territoriais e do uso da \u00e1gua. A arquiteta Nath\u00e1lia Larsen (Instituto de Patrim\u00f4nio Hist\u00f3rico e Art\u00edstico Nacional) apresentou a import\u00e2ncia dos dados abertos para \u00f3rg\u00e3os p\u00fablicos, discutiu leis que circundam o patrim\u00f4nio hist\u00f3rico e mostrou como o mapeamento colaborativo pode ser instrumento de ressignifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos bens culturais. A \u00faltima palestra do per\u00edodo da manh\u00e3 foi da discente Ana Lu\u00edsa Teixeira (presidente do Capitulo UAIGeo \u2013 UFSJ), sobre como o Cap\u00edtulo filiado a Youthmappers pode contribuir para o mapeamento local. No per\u00edodo da tarde, as discentes Ana Lu\u00edsa Teixeira e Ana Lu\u00edsa Marques Carvalho e a Profa Dra Silvia Elena Ventorini mostraram as capacidades de usos das ferramentas Kobo Toolbox, Mapillary e OpenStreetMap em diferentes \u00e1reas do conhecimento. O p\u00fablico participante foi: 43 pessoas no per\u00edodo da manh\u00e3 e 37 no per\u00edodo da tarde. O p\u00fablico foi composto por professores universit\u00e1rios, discentes de gradua\u00e7\u00e3o e p\u00f3s-gradua\u00e7\u00e3o e membros da comunidade local. Para a emiss\u00e3o de certificados, os participantes assinaram uma lista de presen\u00e7a por meio do Google formul\u00e1rios. 65% dos participantes responderam o question\u00e1rio de avalia\u00e7\u00e3o sobre o evento. A an\u00e1lise dos dados indicou que todos consideraram o evento proveitoso e desejam participar de outros eventos feitos pelo Cap\u00edtulo. ",

      "report_question_1": "For our online session during Open Data Day we organized a webinar called \u201cMonitoreando Femicidios en Venezuela con Utopix\u201d (Monitoring Femicides in Venezuela with Utopix). Sahili Franco Cipriani, editor, producer and translator, moderated the activity and introduced the speakers. Then, she lead the space for Indhira Libertad Rodr\u00edguez (who spoke about the contextualization of violence in Venezuela and Latin America under an intersectional and gender justice perspective), militant part of the Red de Colectivos La Ara\u00f1a Feminista, who was our special guest. After, Aimee Zambrano Ortiz, founder of the femicide monitor, introduced the monitor and shared our data and methodology. After, Sahili intervened with the importance of feminist data and the relation between gender and social science, and finally we opened the floor for questions and answers, which lasted almost 40 minutes. The debate was exquisite. Our webinar lasted 1hr and 59 minutes.\n\nFor the promotion of the event we published [an entry on our website](https://utopix.cc/anexos/open-data-day-monitoreando-femicidios-en-venezuela-con-utopix/). Then, we designed a flyer and shared it through Whatsapp, Facebook and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CL5T6iMB7Vl/) along a [Google Registration form](https://forms.gle/vwj7rB3U8NHs7dPb8) so participants could register and we could gather info regarding who was interested: we asked for names, emails, countries, how had they known of the activity and if they wanted to be part our mail list. Then, a day before the event, we shared the Zoom link with the 77 registered persons from Latin America, America and the US. Of that total, 23 participated in the webinar and by the time we were done, 21 were in the room, most of them form Venezuela. The number remained throughout the whole session. The link on the Facebook page has more than 400 views.",
      "report_question_2": "What we\u2019ve learned:\n1) Promote the event widely in advance. We did it with less than a week from the event.\n2) Centralise and optimise the automatic mail response with the Zoom link after people have registered. MailChimp is our best choice so far, as it\u2019s the engine we use in our website. Sending emails with the event link manually is exhausting and has a human error range.\n3) Ask for phone numbers in the registration form as it helps to send a reminder of the event.\n4) Hosting the event through Zoom (or other platform) in parallel with YouTube or Facebok is definitely a great idea; afterwards we have a secure link for sharing our event so people can watch it.\n5) The moderator cannot be a panelist as well. Although it was a success, it worked because there were twenty or so people in the room. If there had been more it would have been difficult to tend to both roles.",
      "report_question_3": "It was an amazing opportunity to not only share data across the globe, but to bring together people from different localities and countries in a single space and share knowledge and points of view regarding gender-based violence in its femicide form, the situation in Latin America, and how we have been working to shift the world. It's a special and incredible important event for human kind, and we do hope to continue participating in it. It was an honour.",

      "report_question_1": "The Open Data Day 2021 was successfully hosted and celebrated in Mungofa Village by the netsquared Musana community. The theme of the day was \u2018Open Data Development in an age of social fissures, insecurity and COVID19 in rural Zimbabwe\u2019, bringing together 50 participants from Chegumo, Musana, Bindura and Matepatepa.\n\nThe event was hosted in both virtual and physical formats with support of The Pelican Trust in Bindura, which brought together multiple stakeholders, locals and students, to empower them in advancing open data in this part of the world in a rural dynamic setting. The event started at 3pm with a theoretical session and ended with a practical workshop at 7pm. The theoretical high impact session was hosted to be shared with participants on the basic concept of open data, its importance, and how it could be accelerated across rural settings. This was demonstrated through a presentation from organisers, panel members and community stakeholders who shared examples of the impact of open data on government intermediaries, education and healthcare in strengthening citizen engagement and access to life saving techniques in the community. And the importance of the release of data sets.\n\nOur event helped to encourage local participants to use open data for local content development in Zimbabwe, showing how data could be made available for everyone to use, especially government data.\n\nThe driving concept was resourcing technologies that could be used for smart visualisation of data and how data could be made available on a database for everyone to use to encourage development, social cohesion and innovative collaboration. We also discovered that most data has not been made accessible across rural Zimbabwe . In order to encourage innovation, transparency, and collaboration we need to advance the open data movement in Zimbabwe,The workshop empowered locals to use social media platforms to talk about their experiences, expand knowledge and broaden their networks about data and to share it for reuse. We also made them understand that research data must be made available for people to reuse and distributed for everyone to visualise it. We also empowered the participants on how they can make their data available socially, teaching participants that they can share data from social media to other communication platforms or social media platforms like WhatsApp as most participants and community citizens in the rural setting appeared to have access to WhatsApp groups and platforms.\n\nThe event was fun, informative and appreciated by every participant even with the technological glitches that we experienced throughout the day. The central takeaway from participants was their interest and engagement on issues relating to transparency and methods in supporting public oversight of government and helping to reduce corruption by enabling greater transparency at local levels.",
      "report_question_2": "This year, our theme centred on 'Open Data Development in an age of social fissures, insecurity and COVID-19 in rural Zimbabwe' and we learnt that data and information are still political tools that are used based on the benefits to stakeholders that use it as a pawn as and when they see fit, while also realising that the girl child is still marginalised when it comes to access to information that would benefit the development of communities and reduce the gender gap in regard to post-educational opportunities and training.\n\nWhile we had interlooping hiccups for transmission of links we used to educate girls in other remote villages that had looked foward to a physical event and were sidelined due to travel restrictions, we found that YouTube remains an important window to the world when used correctly to educate communities as we did using: \n\n[https://youtu.be/L-7Y7pY0GV4](https://youtu.be/L-7Y7pY0GV4)\n[https://youtu.be/og-UNP1ZvPU](https://youtu.be/og-UNP1ZvPU)\n[https://youtu.be/nkrhO2TkFqo](https://youtu.be/nkrhO2TkFqo)\n\nWe also learnt that as most rural communities are still moving away from cultural barriers that hinder acceptance, translation and understanding of the world events around them using videos and training tools that gave examples of other African countries appeared to give comfort in accepting the messages and training via video. In light of the lessons we have learnt that as civil society we still have a lot of work to be done in order to work with stakeholders locally to make access to data for all a basic human right for the greater good.",
      "report_question_3": "At Rausing (Zimbabwe), we love Open Data Day as we feel it is an important event and occasion to mark the importance of access to information and community-driven solutions globally in an age where data is often used as a represive tool that hinders development of marginalised communities across the world and especially rural communities where we work and see the effects of lack of access to data. We have also realised that this is an opportunity at grassroots level to showcase to community leaders and other relevant stakeholders the benefits of open data, while encouraging the adoption of open data policies in rural and local government, rural business spaces and rural community organisations.\n\nCOVID-19 has had a significant social and economic impact across vulnerable communities with misinformation, false news, lack of access to life saving news and procedures and protocols for enhancing health awareness techniques through global campaigns and we have managed to be a bridge to provide high impact applied learning, increase local skills and provision of capacity building tooling during this amazing day. We joined the 2021 annual event to promote awareness and use of open data in Mungofa Village using multiple activities that were conducted according to COVID-19 (WHO) guidelines that included a talk/seminar and digital demonstrations and data training. We also managed to meet the local chief whom we had extensive discussion and talks on data and information being important for all and the need for it to always available, free and accessible all the time.\n",

Mapping practices in most of the cases also reveal new data about the world around us.\n\nErin\u2019s intervention focused on their work on housing injustices in different regions of the world. Their projects made use of different kinds of data - from official records to crowdsourced data to oral history audiovisual material - to discuss current housing injustices and reveal possible ways of intervention.\n\nKitti\u2019s presentation about her work with children and marginalized groups underlined that experiences, feelings, and personal stories of people are important elements which we may wish to collect, discuss and present, if we are thinking about future trajectories of urban neighbourhoods.\n\nIn the second part of the workshop a smaller group of participants (around 20 people) worked collectively in a [Miro](https://miro.com/) whiteboard, and discussed how gentrification changed urban environments around the world and especially in Budapest. Group discussion revolved around the questions of displacement, changing small commerce and people\u2019s desires. Groups developed symbologies and mapped urban change due to gentrification in contemporary Budapest (see the attached photo) and shared existing community mapping projects from their context.",
      "report_question_2": "The event showed us how collective/critical cartography can help reveal social processes from macro-level processes on the global scale to micro-level processes on the scale of the human body.\u00a0\n\nThe presentations referred to a wide range of sources which can be mobilised in collective/critical mapping projects. A lesson learned is also that during such collaborative projects, it is sometimes the collaboration process itself which is the result of the map-making, in some cases a new understanding of the world around us, whereas in some cases co-created maps help us to develop collective action against dominant narratives and existing power structures. Mapping is a way of gaining ownership over data and using it for advocacy purposes.\n\nParticipants of the second half of the workshop emphasised that they learned that collective/critical mapping is a fruitful method in mobilising and revealing knowledges of communities they are working with; how powerful maps might be in presenting data; as well as how online tools and platforms offer us valuable alternatives for working with communities in times when personal meeting is not possible.",

      "report_question_1": "On March 6, we held the afternoon event themed in 'Open Data for Democracy,' which includes two main sessions. The event was held hybrid: about 40 participants were in our office, while about 100 participants joined online.\n\nThe first session features 15-minute talks. We invited 4 guest speakers to give some update and opinion about open data in Thailand and neighboring countries. The topics include :\n- Dream and Hope : what could we have if we have open data in our country, by a speaker from Malaysiakini\n- Welcome to the real world! : open data situation in Thailand, by a chief editor of Thairath (Thailand's biggest media)\n- What's next? : suggestion for Thailand's data governance structure, by a researcher and academic\n- Understand Better! : PDPA (Personal Data Protection Act) and open data in Thailand, by a researcher and academic\n\nThe other session features 1-hour panel discussion. We invited 3 guest speakers from research institute (Siam Lab), civil organization (iLaw), and civic technology (ELECT) to discuss about open government. The topics include :\n- What is open government and how does it deal with open data?\n- How open data can support democracy in our country? And what's the problems now?\n- What have we lost when we don\u2019t have open data?\n- What's our next expectation? And what can/should  the government and people do?\n\nWe also held a mini data exhibition, gathering all our and our partners' projects that deal with government data, to narrate the struggling process of establishing each project and why open data matters.\n\nBefore and after the event day, we also held clubhouse sessions, inviting other guests and those who are interested in this issue, but can't join the event day, to discuss about open data as well.\n\nA summary of the event is published here: [https://elect.in.th/open-data](https://elect.in.th/open-data) (it's in Thai - please use translator)",
      "report_question_2": "- Even most participants admired all speakers we invited, but we think we should decrease numbers of speakers but give them more time to go more into details\n- We thought we should think about more activities to let participants join and do something. (We started thinking about this event a bit too late - maybe next year :))\n- We have a lot of untouched domain for open data; we have a lot of things to do!",

      "report_question_1": "Our organisation has been working with open data for five years and during this time we have built a large open data community in Ukraine. In 2021, our team (including specialists from the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, the USAID Project TAPAS, Eastern Europe Foundation, and the 1991 Open Data Incubator) decided to go beyond the community and focus on how open data improves average person's lives.\n\nFor one day, we launched a real Open Data Television \u2013 with news, life stories, sports, weather forecast, and even the Wheel of Fortune show. All these 'TV programs' revealed the situation with open data in the country and easily showed people that their lives can change thanks to open data products and services.",
      "report_question_2": "We realised that the topic of open data is really of interest to a wide audience. Communication with this audience can give us new allies in the fight against corruption, but this requires effort and 'translate' information about open data into plain language, without specific deadlines. \n\nWe may have to simplify the information a bit and sacrifice details, but the task of the first contact with the 'cold' audience is not to teach but to interest. We need to explain why people need to know about open data and motivate them to explore. They will then find the resources to understand the topic, start using products and thus make the realm of open data more stable.",
      "report_question_3": "Since the Revolution of Dignity 2013-2014, Ukraine has continued to fight corruption, move closer to European integration and strengthen relations with our international partners. For us, the topic of open data is inextricably linked with the transparency of governance, the development of state institutions, and the strengthening of democracy. Therefore, we take every opportunity to advocate for open data and are pleased to join the celebration of Open Data Day at the national level for the third time in a row.",

The proposed topics covered the tools and laws of transparency, participation and open data in Argentina, the comparative sample of open data from official national and local environment web pages and how to use them, and finally the invited organization \"Ecos D Mar\" made an exhibition of data on oil exploitation in the Argentine seas, its negative impact on the environment and the actions that the organization carried out to try to preserve the environment and marine fauna.\u00a0\n\nAfter each talk, discussions were held between the attendees and the speakers, to try to reach conclusions and solutions to the problems raised. The attendees participated with great enthusiasm in each debate proposed at the event.\u00a0\n\nFinally, we must emphasise that, as every year, the representation of gender was very important. Of the 3 speakers, 2 were women and the third a man. Likewise, the audience was mostly women.",

They demonstrated the importance of collaborative work between environmental organisations and organisations specialized in working with data and technology. The event showed the enormous possibilities that open data provide through its analysis and processing to predict environmental impact.\u00a0\n\nThe event served to demonstrate the enormous importance of citizen commitment to prevent negative environmental impacts and preserve the environment and the great importance that civil society organizations have in controlling the acts of governments and companies that can affect the environment. Attendees learned about the legal instruments of participation and transparency that can be used to participate in public life.",

According to local reports, up to 100 metres of land has been invaded by Lake Tanganyika and thousands of houses were destroyed by the flooding. And due to the lack of risk information, this scenario could happen every year if no informative mechanism is set up locally.\n\nThis is why on the occasion of Open Data Day 2021, DRM Africa organised an event whose mission was to prevent vulnerable communities from river floods by providing risk information to exposed communities and the use of open data principles.\n\nDuring the event, up to 10 participants including journalists and representatives from local counties were informed about risk areas and developed preventive measures for vulnerable communities.\n\nVarious activities dedicated to reducing the disaster risk through open data were carried including;\u00a0\u2022 The flood risk analysis in the field and identification of infrastructures under floods risk\u00a0\u2022 Creation and production of risk data\u00a0\u2022 Communication of risk data through local radio stations\n\nVarious tools and techniques for data collection, analysis and communication have been used during the event including OpenStreetMap, Kobo Toolbox for remote data collection, etc.\n\nAfter the project\u2019s completion, infrastructures under risk were identified, counted and represented into datasets and spatial data in order to better inform exposed communities.\n\nThe event was animated by Kashindi Pierre, the CEO of DRM Africa.",

Nine speakers were chosen to speak at the event and their background was well balanced with representatives from civil society, business and government (including Digital Governance Agency, Squander Detector, Bank of Georgia, Atlantic Council, etc.).\n\nPechaKucha Night is a simple presentation format where the speakers show 20 images, each for 20 seconds. The images advance automatically and the presenters talk along to the images. PechaKucha is a Japanese word (\u30da\u30c1\u30e3\u30af\u30c1\u30e3) and it means \u201cbla-bla-bla\u201d or \u201dchit-chat\u201d. \n\nThe format gave us the chance to briefly go through assessing the landscape in different sectors in Georgia and was followed by lively discussions. 130 people registered to participate in PechaKucha Night Tbilisi.\n",

The important part is that our platform would not be possible without open data and we hope we can give back the data we created on top of it to the projects we used it from. Only then it is in the true sense of sharing: everyone shares and makes it better for everyone. Another interesting point for us is, that we plan to synthesise data out of our users activity (with their consent of couse!) into more data we are happily contributing back.",
      "report_question_2": "I think especially in a field like permaculture, where many information is anectodal created by individual herbalists but never really peer-reviewed by a wider audience, open data plays an important role of moving the field to the next level. Out of individual observations, people need to blindly trust to crowd-verified and open data. This was also reflected in the discussion we had after. People are mostly interested in permaculture but lack open data they can use to understand and learn by themselves.",

The event was celebrated in two sessions; in my neighborhood with students of all age groups and with the secondary school students at Government Secondary School Kang Barombi.\u00a0\n\nThe event was celebrated under the theme \u201cRaising awareness in students and uses of open data to solve community challenges\u201d. The main objective of organising this event was to build capacity, create awareness on data use and illustrate to students how they could solve community issues using data.\n\nThe objectives of this event were:\n\u2022 To raise awareness on what open data was all about, its availability and data issue in Cameroon.\n\u2022 Building capacity of the students, sharing the benefits in the use of open data and how data can help drive innovation and solve community challenges. The work was structured on demonstration and presentation of mini-project belts of using open data, structured presentation, networking and collaboration.\u00a0\n\nThe following topics were explained in detail to the students:\n\u2022 Social and economic aspects of open data in society.\u00a0\n\u2022 Media and journalism data, Marketing and social media data, business directory data, academic data etc...\n\u2022 Encouraging youth to explore open data and to digitally transform Cameroon.\n\u2022 Using open data as a means to secure public and private funds.\n\u2022 The use of open data to improve sustainability in agricultural production.\n\nAt the end, we were able to create reasonable awareness on the availability and benefits of open data. We encouraged students to explore open data so as to solve the challenges that plague the society. The students pleaded that an open data organisation should be created in Kumba Town to enhance learning.",
      "report_question_2": "I learned that in events like this, everyone around including kids should be considered because they are the future leaders of tomorrow. Teaching them about it will give them early access to data which will help drive innovation.\n\nAfter facing numerous challenges such as electricity and power failure, I learn how to improvise and use local materials such as lamps, cardboard, bold makers, etc... to present my ideas in a more logical and illustrative manner.\n\nI equally learned the benefits of open data in the following domain:\n\n\u2022 **Transparency**. Open data supports public oversight of governments and helps reduce corruption by enabling greater transparency.\u00a0\n\u2022 **Public Service Improvement**. Open data gives citizens the raw materials they need to engage their governments and contribute to the improvement of public services.\u00a0\n\u2022 **Innovation and Economic Value**. Public data, and their re-use, are key resources for social innovation and economic growth. Open data provides new opportunities for governments to collaborate with citizens and evaluate public services by giving citizens access to data about those services.\u00a0\n\u2022 **Efficiency**. Open data makes it easier and less costly for government ministries to discover and access their own data or data from other ministries, which reduces acquisition costs, redundancy and overhead.",

We had participant both online and onsite attend the event. a total of 32 people were onsite and 21 people online. \n\nData were drawn from UNICEF, Nigeria Bureau of statistics and Water Aid were used as reference points for the discussion where it said 3 in 10 people in Nigeria don't have safe water close to home, 3 in 5 people in Nigeria don't have a toilet of their own.; 4 in 5 people in Nigeria lack handwashing facilities at home. 60 million Nigerians, or 33 per cent of the population, do not have access to safe water. We displayed out communities in Plateau state, Kaduna and the country's capital Abuja, where it can be seen that 10 in 10 people had no access to safe water, 5 in 5 not having access to handwashing facilities, with our research, we discovered that lack of access to WASH facilities is greatly caused by corruption, access to data, which leads to low participation of citizens in governance and its processes. To change this narrative, we built the capacity of participants on budget data sieving, how to effectively use the Freedom of Information Act as a tool for demanding information on the project and providing oversight on its implementations, leveraging social media as a tool for engaging government officials and amplifying corrupt cases in their communities.\n\nGarba, a participant highlighted how he used the FOI and social media to engage and amplify corrupt practices as well as amplify the living conditions of people around his community, but it came with a price, he was invited by the government security agency for questioning, but he was able to get out of it easily as he posted on social media, and tagged relevant CSOs which came to his aid with legal council.\n\nAnother participant, Precious Adigwe was concerned about how citizens in rural communities are able to have the knowledge of data since it is complex and it is hard for them to understand and make actionable decisions. Wilson Atumeyi explained that in such cases, it is even unwise to use their local languages to make print works, as some of them can not read their local dialect, so it is advisable to make creative designs that when you have a glance at them, you will know what it means without reading a text, then get someone that understands their language to take them on the session for better understanding.\n\nFinally, we agreed to create a knowledge-sharing platform where members can share data sieved for better engagement and a coalition that would ensure that this information is used to drive transparency and accountability in governance.

La transmisi\u00f3n se hizo a trav\u00e9s de Facebook, YouTube y Periscope, y esto nos permiti\u00f3 llegar a 359 personas, una cifra mayor a la prevista. Cerramos con la rifa de diez ejemplares de la gu\u00eda \u201cFiscalizar desde el periodismo. Una gu\u00eda para monitorear obras y compras p\u00fablicas\u201d, editada por Ojoconmipisto.\n\nSilvio Gramajo, especialista en temas de transparencia, explic\u00f3 los conceptos sobre informaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica. La rendici\u00f3n de cuentas, dijo, debe enfocarse en \u201clos cuentos de la cuenta\u201d. Es decir, en narrativas que expliquen las decisiones tomadas por cada municipalidad.\n\nIsaias Morales, reportero de Ojoconmipisto y autor de la gu\u00eda, se centr\u00f3 en los pasos a seguir para encontrar informaci\u00f3n en Guatecompras, el portal que registra todas las compras estatales, y en otros sitios de Datos Abiertos del ministerio de Finanzas. Son espacios que la ciudadan\u00eda puede utilizar para seguir la ruta del dinero p\u00fablico.\n\nDaniel Ambeliz, analista de datos, comparti\u00f3 herramientas que utiliza para analizar las compras p\u00fablicas, como Power BI. Hizo uso de una base de datos de compras de 2020 para identificar historias que pod\u00edan ser contadas. Gladys Olmstead, community manager de Ojoconmipisto, comparti\u00f3 las notas informativas m\u00e1s destacadas que partieron de datos y de solicitudes de informaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica para contar no s\u00f3lo como se usan los fondos p\u00fablicos sino tambi\u00e9n como el gobierno informa sobre la Covid\u201319.\n\nSe sortearon diez ejemplares de la gu\u00eda entre los 35 participantes que completaron el funcionario. Se les har\u00e1 llegar por correo.",

Pero tambi\u00e9n quieren aprender a navegar en ellos.\n\nb. Este a\u00f1o se hizo la actividad de forma virtual por las restricciones existentes por la pandemia. Si bien permiti\u00f3 llegar a un n\u00famero mayor de lo previsto (359 versus 25 personas) la interacci\u00f3n fue m\u00e1s limitada a cuando hacemos actividades cerradas.

The ongoing Covid-19 global pandemic, unpredictable weather patterns and climate change, pest plagues like the locust swarms invading parts of Africa, are just some of the tremendous challenges that our food systems and agriculture are experiencing. To celebrate International Open Data Day and reflect on how open data can build resilience in agriculture and food systems, the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT and the CGIAR Platform for Big Data in Agriculture have organized a webinar featuring thought and research leaders in big data and digital technologies in agriculture. The growing availability of data and the smart and effective use of this data in research for development are opportunities to find new, data-driven ways to withstand the impacts of adverse events, nourish people and sustain the planet",
